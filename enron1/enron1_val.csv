"Subject: re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to

changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact
to any downstream processes .
i hope the following will give more clarification .
let me know if you have any questions or need more detail !
thanks ,
dg 3 - 9517
sitara / unify - process
* scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had
been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify .
* impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely
harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues .
* process -
counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b .
ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline .
the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify .
ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change )
ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now
highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high
level , not on path )
the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path
if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path
unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info )
balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info )
the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all
information is correct )
volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out .
( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match
up perfectly )
settlements utilizes information in unify .
settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which
would create two notification entries
if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur .
( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now )
autonoms "" tom ' s words of warning "" -
previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after
deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi
path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already
nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct
the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to
manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify
( as explained above ) .

subject : re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to

fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
"" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . ""
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
"" warning - not the same legal entity ""
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .
in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be
necessary .
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
manager .
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you
are looking for will appear .
i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
updates its information

dr . nkem george .
bank of the north ,
victoria island branch ,
lagos , nigeria .
my dear friend ,
i am dr . nkem george . , branch manager with bank of
the north , victoria island branch , lagos , nigeria .
i have an urgent and very profitable business
proposition for you that should be handled with
extreme confidentiality .
on january 6 , 1999 a foreign oil consultant and
contractor with the nigerian national petroleum
corporation ( nnpc ) mr . james herbert by name made a
numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months
valued at us $ 38 . 6 m ( thirty eight million , six hundred
united states dollars only ) in my branch .
upon maturity i sent a routine notification in
accordance with the bank policy to his forwarding
address but got no reply .
after a month we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers the nigerian
national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) that mr . james
herbert died from an automobile accident .
on further investigation , we found out that he died
without making a will and all attempts to trace his
next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further
investigations and discovered that mr . james herbert
did not declare any next of kin or relations in all
his official documents including his bank deposit
paperwork in my bank .
this sum of us $ 38 . 6 m has been carefully moved out of
my bank to a security company in europe for
safekeeping .
no one will ever come forward to claim it and
according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 5 and
half years the money will revert to the ownership of the
nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the
fund .
this prompted us to contact you . we will like to front
you as the next of kin of our late client thereby
making you the legal beneficiary of the sum of $ 38 . 6
million u . s dollars that is presently in a security
company in europe .
i contacted you because it is against our code of
ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your
assistance would be needed to claim the money in the
security company in europe .
we have unanimously agreed that 25 % of the entire sum
would be for you if you agree to take part in this
profitable transaction , 70 % for me and 2 of my
colleagues while the remaining 5 % would be used to pay
back the expenses that may be incurred during the
course of the transaction by both parties after the
fund has been claimed and lodged in your account .
in the event that you are genuinely interested in the
transaction , the following information would be needed
from you to expedite action .
1 ) your full name and address that would be used to
establish you as the next of kin of our late client
thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the fund .
this would ensure that the security company in europe
releases the consignment / fund to you .
2 ) your private mobile , telphone and fax numbers where
you can be reached at all time because this
transaction entails constant communication .
the transaction is 100 % risk free as all modalities
has been perfected to ensure the hitch free success of
the transaction .
if you are interested , send the requested information
via email
i await your response urgently .
regards ,
dr . nkem george .

hey joe ,
here ' s the response i got with regards to tomcat . i ' ve place another call
into david and let him know that the information we received included most
points except for tomcat . i ' ll keep you informed .
what i know is that the gas is sourced at mi 587 and moved on km ' s firm
contract . for as long as ces remembers , they sell the gas to entex . entex
chooses the pipe off which they take - - usually midcon - - also , hpl channel , or
tejas . km is invoiced directly . volume is approx . 2395 . the deal with entex
is written up monthly . km pays on a basket of indices . entex pays on the
highest index .

"Subject: microsoft plus x , p update
minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said .",spam

"Subject: budget help ! !
salaries , salaries , salaries ! ! ! everyone is having problems .
unfortunately , many of
you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your
staff ' s salary is . i have the average
salary for each of the different staffing levels . i have asked the hr
department to also give me
the low and the high . let ' s face it - your staff today and their salary most
likely are not what
they are going to be next year ! to much movement of people . so using
estimates and averages
will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels .
here ' s what you can do :
1 ) make a list of your staff just their positions .
2 ) then put down if you think i should budget high , mid , average , low , low to
average , etc .
you can guess at this based on their experience , length of time in that
position , etc .
3 ) then i will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget .
4 ) here is the average :
sr . $ 4 , 961
spec $ 3 , 964
staff $ 3 , 026
sr . clrk $ 2 , 548
clerk $ 2 , 264
asst $ 3 , 162
your list would look something like this :
assistant average
clerk very high
sr . clerk low
specialist low to average
specialist average
sr . specialist average to high
analyst ( they are all allocated at the same amount )
you can , however , use the exact amounts if you have them . it ' s up to you .
next item - training ! ! !
here ' s what you can do :
1 ) list your staff and the type of class they need
2 ) if you don ' t know the exact class you want to send them to , then list what
type
of class - for example personal enrichment ( i . e . time management ) or
technical ( derivatives or applied finance or wellhead to burnertip )
3 ) the personal enrichment classes cost aroung $ 500 - $ 700
4 ) the technical classes cost aroung $ 800 - $ 1000 .
5 ) just list the type of class , and i ' ll do the rest .
next item - headhunters !
try 20 % of the new hires salary for their fees .
other stuff - i have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the
year that
people forget about at budget time ( i . e . flowers for secretaries day , birthday
ice cream , offsite meeting costs , customer gifts ) . if you forget these
items , i will
make sure it is added to your budget .
once i put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets , we will
review them
so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them . hopefully
this helps you some .

april 2004 top pick of the month
life energy and technology holdings , inc .
( otcbb : leth )
leth receives $ 250 , 000 , 000 in financing to fund the manufacture
of the environmentally friendly biosphere process system
waste - to - energy units in the united states .
first unit to roll - out in new orleans in early second quarter .
we are expecting earth - shattering upcoming news leading a strong
rally in leth for a company that has announced over $ 100 million
in sales orders in the past year , and tops that record - setting
achievement by acquiring the equivalent of $ 8 . 62 per share in
cash for major worldwide expansion .
* * our readers grabbed substantial profits for our march pick * *
ushg featured at . 75
reached 3 . 65 in 8 days !
traded as high as 7 . 00 since !
the biosphere process system - soaring worldwide demand :
leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their
biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal
of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour
which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this
profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean ,
green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste ,
agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial
wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge
market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity
created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating
5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to
replenish the local or national grid .
the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need
for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding
universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste .
leth has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product
designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a
major push for generating electricity from alternative sources
continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power
failures .
financing of $ 250 million positions leth for astronomical sales :
the magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the
fact that this $ 1 . 50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to
$ 8 . 62 per common share in cash . there are 26 biosphere process
systems presently in operation worldwide . the available funding
could easily be used to produce 100 additional biospheres . now factor
in that the average sale price is $ 7 million per biosphere . we
cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with
a potential $ 700 , 000 , 000 in future sales with 29 million shares
outstanding !
leth stock guidance :
current price : 1 . 80
near - term target : 4 . 80
projected high for ' 04 : 12 . 50
leth ' s blue chip partner - fortifying the system :
leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech , inc . ( nasdaq : ttek , $ 21 )
a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical ,
and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us
government with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will
coordinate the securing of necessary permits , installation , and
continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system
for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department
of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in
the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for leth which
opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while
having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge
near - term announcement .
political power fosters rapid global expansion :
leth has captured the profit - making attention of both us and
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global
waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity
from alternative sources . this has been accomplished by successfully
creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the
political contacts at the highest level from dr . albert reynolds ,
chairman of leth , who is also the former prime minister of ireland .
dr . reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding
leth into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with
such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value
to the size of the market .
uncommon value for a company of this caliber :
we are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the biosphere ,
the impressive backlog of over $ 100 million in sales orders , and
the company ' s very solid financial position . we view this perfectly
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional
contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the company ' s
own sales records . as our top stock pick for april , we anticipate
the continuation of strong positive developments that will
ignite leth shares which carry our highest rating for short - term
trading profits followed by robust long - term capital gains .

enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m
enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering , treating , processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for $ 230 . 5 million . the package includes all of the east texas system , which gathers 400 mmcf / d for delivery into the carthage hub .
enbridge energy company president dan c . tutcher said the assets are a "" natural fit "" with enbridge ' s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company ' s "" geographic footprint "" in the region as well as its energy commodity mix . "" we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' '
enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .
the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .
it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .
enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .
third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d .
"" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , "" said tutcher . "" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

"Subject: re : gas nom ' s
we ' ve talked this over at this end and agree we should be taking the following approach :
remind brazos that under exhibit 7 . 12 , page 2 of the ppa , brazos is precluded on any gas day from taking a greater volume of gas than the plant ' s mdq ( 45 , 000 dth / d ) less the amount needed to satisfy its generation request .
the partnership will accept total gas nominations as generation first , gas for resale second . if brazos ' electric nominations by hour would , given ambient conditions , cause us to use at or above the plant ' s mdq under its contracts with apache / williams ( 45 , 000 dth / d ) , gas nominations will be zero . this needs to be handled between the operators . i ' ve emphasized "" at or above "" on purpose ; if an all electric nomination would cause brazos to burn in excess of 45 , 000 dth per day , we will honor that request ( we ' re looking at this with the attorneys and may choose at a future date to change the way this has been administered in the past , as this situation currently causes the partnership to incur an economic loss ) .
after being notified of the need for a schedule adjustment , brazos is free to reset its hourly electric nominations to allow for gas deliveries to the extent it desires ( provided they ' re still capped at 45 , 000 dth / d if they take gas ) . whenever they go this route , however , we need to hold them to the electric nomination ( i . e . , they should get a courtesy call from an operator each and every time they go over the nominated electricity amount ) . remind brazos that under the ppa , they will be billed for penalties associated with not adhering to their electric nominations on days on which they ' ve elected to take gas .
if the issue of precedent comes up , remind them that we ' re operating in a new territory and that electric - gas nominations have only been made over the past 7 months ; it wasn ' t until recently that we ' ve been able to attribute imbalance penalties to brazos , which has caused us to look at the scheduling provisions of the agreement much more closely .
as a show of good faith , we should also make an attempt to track gas consumed / nominated for redelivery and advise them toward the end of the month of opportunities to up their gas nominations .
hope this helps to clarify where we are .

energy . however , i want everone of us to understand that a nomination from
brazos for a 6312 mwh , s ( 263 / hr ) , will require the plant to utilize 47 , 500 to
48 , 500 mbtu ' s at this ambient temperature to deliver the requested energy .
to allow brazos any gas the total delivered electrical energy would have to
be something less than 258 mw loading per hour .

on the deal ticket and the economics will work out correctly . it will keep
things in balance a bit better , but you can go either way . for feb there is a

"Subject: jill ,
i have had several discussions with daren farmer and below are a few questions remaining .
ann mag - which plant does this gas come into or out of ? daren farmer indicated that ngpl / trunkline is connected to la gloria ( agua dulce ) and tenn / coral / shannel are connected to the gulf plains plant ( agua dulce minus ) . do we have an option on which plant tailgait we would like delivery ? if so daren said we would prefer the gulf plains plant .
oakhill - are all three at the carthage hub ? if so , then the texas desk will give a quote , probably hsc minus , otherwise the east and central desk will need to quote the volume into tetco and koch mid , respectively .
vaquillas ranch km - what plant processes this gas ?
white heron - where is this ? could not find it on the map and daren was not familiar with this field .
sheridan field - daren assumed this was the shell sheridan plant , but he wanted to verify with you .
hungerford north - where is this ?
bear den - where is this ?
moore ' s station - where is this ?
dan hughes - hpl is quoting this volume ( as well as several other field connected to hpl ) and they need a meter number for this field .
we have one less day to get these quotes than originally anticipated because of friday being "" good friday "" and basically all of the 32 nd floor being out , myself included .
so , let me know via voicemail or email what you can find out regarding the above questions . the properties we do not have any questions on are currently being quoted up , or will be tomorrow morning .

pat ,
i have been working with volume management , settlements , vance , and bob to
clean up some prior period and prior - to - current month issues . this process
should result in a correction to booked profit / loss for vance and the desk .
this has brought to my attention that we have been paying some parties
manually for volumes when deals are not correctly entered . i would propose
that logistics be included in the communication of when checks are manually
cut . it would be especially beneficial if we tracked manual checks by
counterparty , meter , and / or deal ticket id or price . i feel that this will
allow us to spot and resolve potential issues more effectively .
please let me know what your thoughts are on this matter .

subject : mobil discrepancies
lee ,
here are some specific situations i am trying to resolve regarding volume on
centana :
purchase from mobil :
2 / 99 - the purchase by hplr for 155 , 000 mms in deal 60978 was never billed by
mobil .
( a purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in
sitara ) .
per our conversation friday , it sounds like hplc does owe mobil for his
gas , right ?
sale to mobil :
1 / 2000 - per the pipe statement provided by greg bonin for centana volumes ,
299 , 893
flowed in january . i billed 299 , 893 and mobil paid it .
logistics said 19 , 893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to mobil
because
the gas wasn ' t scheduled . in addition , if the 19 , 893 were a sale to mobil ,
the
point would not be in balance in the system . the source of 280 , 000 of the
gas
says they only sold 280 , 000 mms and not any more . no other sources are in the
system .
i assume if the 19 , 893 wasn ' t consumed by mobil , they wouldn ' t have
paid for it . is there storage involved here ? if so , whose storage and how
did it work ?
there are sales in other months with discrepancies on centana with smaller
volumes
than in 1 / 2000 . once i understand what happened in january , maybe that will
help me
with the other months .
please let me know if there is any other information you need from me
relating to
the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this . i
can bring
the pipe statements to you if that would help .
thanks ,

pop queen madonna is so frustrated she sacrificed her education for pop music - she ' s allegedly enrolled at britain ' s prestigious oxford university for a degree in english literature . the material girl rekindled her love of books after writing popular children ' s series the english roses , and is looking forward to studying for a bachelor of arts qualification from home , with the celebrated institution which counts four british kings , 47 nobel prize - winners , 25 british prime ministers and six saints as past students . an insider tells britain ' s the sun newspaper , madonna was always irritated about giving up her schooling when her career took off . she is fiercely intelligent and incredibly well read and has always taken a keen interest in literature . she is determined to get a qualification . she sets herself new challenges all the time and the oxford university course is her latest . it ' s an illustrious place to study and she was delighted to be accepted and will make the most of the opportunity .

thanks , bob . it now turns out that due to operational issues , the additional 10 , 000 / d may not come on next week . spinnaker is having problems dealing with all the condensate associated with this gas and may not have the proper equipment in place to allow the additional gas to flow and also handle the additional condensate associated with that gas . i ' ll keep you posted .

the texas general land office transport volume is in pops for may nominated at 4 , 800 / d . deal # 535132 was initially set up as a wellhead purchase from texas general land office . the transport volume of 4 , 800 / d comprises approximately 22 % of the total volume nominated at the meter .

the houston exploration company sit 535119 5 , 045 / d 23 %
it appears that the texas general land office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for may - see deal 535132 , which shows 0 as the expectted volume . texas glo has historically transported about 23 % of the gas at the n . padre is . block 883 l .
once it starts flowing , the incremental 10 , 000 mmbtu / d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above .

please see the following instructions for the new messenging board . if you
have any trouble entering into this site , please let me know . everyone
should now be setup and ready to go . you will have to add this site to one of
your favorites .
the gas message board application can run on both ie 5 . 0 and ie 5 . 5 now .
attached is the url for user to run the application .
http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com
please feel free to forward above url to people who like to test the
application .
here is the steps they should do :
1 ) launch internet explorer
2 ) type : http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com ( or just open this email and
click on above url )
3 ) users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today . if
they don ' t see any messages , there are two reasons :
( 1 ) they are not valid users . their names have not been added into the nt
web _ gastraders group yet . please contact chrysti hardy to add their names
into the group .
( 2 ) there is no new messages added yet .
4 ) click on "" comments "" button to add messages : there will be a popup window
when user clicks on "" comments "" button . there are two ways to send the
messages after typing the
messages into the text box :
( 1 ) just simply press enter to send the message . or
( 2 ) click on "" send "" button to send the message .
5 ) after the message has been sent , the message will be displayed on the main
window immediately , the rest people who are online will get the new message
in less than 30 seconds . this time can be reduced to as less as 1 second .
however , i would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10
second . because each time the browser refreshes the screen , the screen will
be blink . users don ' t want the screen blink every second while they read the
messages .
6 ) all messages will be cleaned up daily at 6 : 00 pm . if they like to clean
them up later than 6 : 00 pm , please let me know . i can reset the time .
note : right now the application is under test environment . if they like it , i
will move it into production environment soon .
let me know any feedbacks .

"Subject: i found something !
finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout .",ham

sherlyn ,
the pops meters 7107 , 7108 , and 7109 need to stay non allocatable and need to be allocated on unit gas pipeline . you will need daren or michael at enron to do the following
add meters 7107 , 7108 and 7109 on unit pipeline to sitara deals 70550
70549
70119
then you can run the pops 53 report for these meters or use your allocation to properly allocate to the meters on unit pipeline .
once this is done , let me know and i will zero out the pops meters .

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said .",spam

"Subject: desk to desk deals
during mid - july , sitara will change the logic on desk to desk deals to post
the volume associated with the sales ( seller ) side to the sitara deal .
currently , the volume on the receipt ( buyer ) side is being posted . this
change will be implemented in order to coincide with the logic currently
being used in sap . this change should help to avoid intercompany imbalances .
please be aware that this change will effect desk to desk deals only . the
logic on transport usage deals will remain as it is currently - delivery

t after she took that shot & didn ' t . but she was high before she took it & i guess she didn ' t think about it getting low . i don ' t know what will happen to her when she leaves home .
but anyway , i wanted to let you know that we ' re going to dallas to look for the prom dress & shoes , don ' t know if we will stay all night or not . i haven ' t talked to shane & shelley . i wanted to stay & go to saturn rd . to church & go to the singles class . but i don ' t know what shane & shelley have planned . so we ' ll be back either sat . night or sun . lacy has to be back to work on 3 research papers & projects that are all due at once . so , wish us luck . any donations will be appreciated ! i hear they ' re more than i was expecting . but anyway , i don ' t intend to go overboard . maybe there will be some sales .

10 m at lomax . i went into sitara and updated the deal ticket , pathed and
nominated over to pops .
saturday 1 / 20 / 01 - 8 : 30 am sean paged regarding the nomination at dow
freeport , he was questioning the validity , as we do not often flow at this
meter . i checked and the nomination was good for saturday ' s gas day . sean
informed me that the valero refinery was up and down and would be going
completely down on sunday .
10 : 00 am - sean called regarding tejas laporte , meter 665 . apparently , the
meter had a confirmed volume of 20 m and hpl / ena had no deal at the meter .
checked in pops and discovered that the deal was confirmed at 20 m on a deal
volume of zero . informed sean that the tejas volume was confirmed . also ,
per sean koch george west ( meter 6722 ) had a nomination increase of 10 m ,
which he wanted to confirm .
sunday 1 / 21 / 01 10 : 00 am sean paged regarding the dow meter 1442 , pops still
showed a confirmed voume of 10 m which dow and oasis showed at zero for
sunday . i checked the system and confirmed that the meter was indeed at
zero and phoned sean back to confirm . checked on mtp hardy , sean informed me
that we came in on rate for saturday and that current meter activity looked
good .",ham

hi daren ,
i ' m attempting to clear the above mentioned meter from an error report

due to no volumes being scheduled in pops but volumes appearing in mops . the
volumes @ this meter is for 4449 ( sitara deal tickets 240095 and 227697 . due
to this being a "" check meter "" the volumes will not bridge to pops from mops .

"Subject: hplr liquids / humble gas pipeline
we need to get together this afternoon at 2 : 00 pm in room 3745 to discuss how
we will schedule and allocate the hplr liquids coming into humble gas
pipeline at meter 8793 . karry , it is my understanding that you do not want
an intercompany sale from hplr liquids to hplc at this point . how do you
plan to get this gas to king ranch since hplr liquids does not have a
transport on humble ?
daren , the intercompany hplc purchase is how it is set up currently in mops .
robert , since stella is out , we will need someone to represent logistics .

george ,
gary called me about this shut in situation a few minutes ago , specifically
regarding meter 6722 . this meter is at the tailgate of three rivers ,
therefore , an hpl field employee will not be able to contact the producer
( they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through
this meter ) .
gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally , and then
connie sutton will follow up with written notice . per our discussion , since
mary jo and gary are out this afternoon , i am forwarding this message to you .
the concerned contracts are : cody texas , lp , 012 - 64365 - 101 , 96018049 and

"Subject: new version of stack manager
introduction
in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have
upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your
products .
this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days .
please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade .
summary of new features
multiple children - a "" child "" product can be the "" parent "" of another child
( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed
against a single parent .
static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and
hit the "" + "" or "" - "" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount
in product properties until you logout .
sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on
the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your "" shift "" key .
parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis
relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : "" basis
link - parent "" and now would say "" stand alone , parent "" ) .
detailed feature descriptions
multiple children
the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together
in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product
b , which is in turn linked to parent product c .
warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a
chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a
customer attempts a transaction , the database must "" lock "" each and every
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the
locks . "" vertical "" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are
much slower to process than "" flat "" chains ( one parent with many children ) .
large vertical chains should be avoided .
related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the
same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent
product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link
to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated
basis link and a regular basis link .
static product bar prices
the new version of enrononline provides for "" sticky "" product bar price and
volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not
reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you
have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "" + "" or "" - "" buttons .
one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it
reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if
the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price
movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder
for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update
moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering
an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price
movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary ,
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure
rate .
you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field
for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products
which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu .
sorting / selecting
the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting
functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type ,
location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple
sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then
location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first
by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in
alphabetical order ) .
if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort
criteria , plus you can select "" sort by web order "" , which allows you to see
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the
website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) .
when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left
mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while
making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not
necessarily adjacent to one another .
parent products and f / x products
one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its
treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the
type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of
the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version
does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for
more than one type of link on each parent product .
some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now
identified with a stylised "" fx "" in the product list . this is to enable easy
identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the
parent , rather than managed individually .
assistance
as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality ,
please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 )
20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) .
general feedback
if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further
functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had
previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this
release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard
to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your
requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .",ham

i ' m still concern about april ' s nom ; if we don ' t take it to zero , than we could have the possibility of the allocations group adding volumes to barrett ' s april deal . this would be incorrect .

hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis ; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april . as for as barrett , they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca ; therefore , 100 % of barrett ' s production is being paid to seneca . consequently , you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties .
let me know is you can ' t .

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout .",ham

subject : update on employee expense reimbursement
post - petition expenses
effective immediately , the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after enron corp . ' s chapter 11 filing ( after december 2 nd ) has returned to normal . expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission . employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors . new travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming . in the meantime , please use discretion as you incur expenses . all expenditures should be made with consideration given to enron ' s current financial situation .
pre - petition expenses
we will immediately begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses for current and former employees ( incurred prior to the december 2 nd chapter 11 filing ) up to a maximum of $ 5 , 000 . we understand that a number of employees have pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . however , under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court , there is a $ 15 , 000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre - petition compensation , benefits , and related employee expenses . this $ 15 , 000 cap was imposed without input from enron management and counsel . we have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $ 15 , 000 cap does not include the reimbursement of medical , dental , or vision related expenses .
we have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical / dental / vision expense issue , we will begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 and up to $ 15 , 000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $ 15 , 000 cap . unfortunately , since this will be a manual process , it will take some time to work through . employees with pre - petition business expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation , including the total amount of pending pre - petition medical / dental / vision claims , to expensereport @ enron . com .

subject : bridgeback error at meter 1450 for 11 / 99
aimee :
there is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month . the
reason for the error is that the deal , # 97929 has expired . please determine
if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it ?
to fix this i will set up an accounting arrangement but what i need from you
is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to
put the deal on .
thanks in advance for your help ,

technologies .
shares outstanding : 34 , oo 0 , ooo

current price : o . 08
will it continue higher ? watch this one monday as we know many of you
like momentum .
breaking news ! !
may 25 , 20 o 5 ! v nomad international inc . ( ndin ) announced today it has
entered into a letter of intent to provide an exclusive license to its
voip products with lmb technologies inc . for the caribbean market which
includes bermuda .
the terms of the letter of intent include a 20 % royalty payable to
nomad of the gross revenue generated by lmb technologies inc . of any sales
and other revenue generated from the license . additional consideration
payable to nomad includes 20 % of the common stock of lmb technologies
inc . which will seek a public listing of its common shares in the u . s
market as soon as practicably possible .
the acquisition of the license is subject to the parties entering into
a definitive agreement and to both the due diligence and board
approvals of lmb technologies inc . and nomad international inc .
pursuant to the proposed acquisition , on closing , lmb technologies inc .
would pay 2 o % of its common stock to nomad international inc . as
consideration payable for the license and would agree to pay 20 % of the gross
revenues generated from any activities related to the license exclusive
to the caribbean market .
! ' the caribbean market is one in which our technology has the
opportunity to potentially gain market share through our ability to provide voip
services over dial up networks . we are please with the distribution
relationships of lmb technologies inc . and hope to see our products in the
caribbean market commercially in the short term . ! ( , stated jan olivier ,
ceo and chairman of nomad international inc .
may 18 - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol
( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build
sustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers
will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to
stifle competition .
the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad
international inc .
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization
worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the
total users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only
approximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore
represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product .
about nomad international inc .
nomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications
company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over
internet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip
product line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl ,
cable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on
targeting : 1 ) national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in
effectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace ,
2 ) large multinational corporations which need to have us or european
presence by having , ( for example ) , a united states number ringing in
their offices in guatemala or london - - offering business partners a more
economical way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a
means of significantly lowering their communication expense with their
relatives in their country of origin .
conclusion :
the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known
companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are
already familiar with this . is ndin poised and positioned to do that for
you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch

"Subject: new enrononline functionality
in order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of enrononline we are rolling out several changes tonight , which will be in effect on monday august 20 , 2001 . some of these changes will affect stack manager while others affect the website . a summary of these changes is listed below .
stack manager changes
top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a "" top of stack entry "" it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .
in order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed top of stack "" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the "" allowed "" option should be selected .
please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out .
restricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a "" top of stack entry "" it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .
in order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as restricted top of stack "" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the "" allowed "" option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "" restricted top of stack "" feature .
advanced filtering ability on all products tab - drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the all products tab in stack manager . in order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title . a drop down box with a list of attributes will appear . highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter . to turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" all "" option from the drop down box .
website changes
new submission screen for restricted top of stack limit orders - the submission screen for products that allow top of stack or restricted top of stack limit orders is as follows .
the submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction , while the button on the right will submit as a limit order . in case of the restricted top of stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box .
price of limit orders
modify limit orders
customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order . in order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the "" today ' s orders "" section . the price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product . once the price is at the desired level click the "" set "" button and the price will be modified . another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order . you will see a box with plus , minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order .
expiration time for limit orders
customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days . currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours .
float the today ' s orders section
you can now float the "" limit order "" section . in order to do so , right click in the "" today ' s orders "" section and select the float window option . in order to make the window "" stay on top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option .
mid market client - mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers , while including their desired margin on the trade , on enrononline products . in order to do so click on the bid or offer price , a customised submission window will appear . select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit . for example if a customer wants to buy nymex sep 01 at 3 . 36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin , please enter 3 . 36 as the desired price and 0 . 01 as the margin . the system will trade the order when the enrononline offer for nymex sep 01 is at 3 . 35 , book the trade at 3 . 36 and record the 0 . 01 origination amount .
in order to be set up to use this functionality . please call the enrononline product control group .
changes to website passwords - as an added security measure , which has been requested by many customers , some new password rules have been instituted . first , the password cannot be equal to the login id . second , each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days . these rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users .
please note stack manager changes will be available all traders as of monday august 20 , 2001 . the changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded monday night , and external users by the end of the week . over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords .
if you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713 - 853 - 1787 .

subject : ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !
thanks in advance .",ham

subject : 24 x 5 products
eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually .
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the "" wkd "" is short for week days . )
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824
thank you .

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

2 . i presume we are not counting both meter 9848 north padre island blk 8 and meter 9862 lehman / spinnaker onshore . isn ' t this the same gas ?
3 . meter 3536 seahawk / a - s ( mat plt 520 ) , eog resources , sitara 725391 : is this purchase properly in the wellhead book ?
4 . meter 6884 pgtt junction 16 "" lease , comstock oil & gas , inc . and kerr - mcgee oil & gas onshore l . p . , sitara 125899 and 132975 : comstock ' s volume should exceed kerr - mcgee ' s volume , and together the two volumes should be approximately 73 , 000 / d . currently , comstock ' s volume is only 8 , 600 / d and kerr - mcgee ' s volume is 25 , 000 / d . we look about 38 , 000 / d short .
5 . meter 639 hannah nash , coral energy resources , l . p . , sitara 659998 : is this purchase properly in the wellhead book ?

"Subject: organisational announcement - introducing enron global markets
as evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter ,
enron  , s wholesale energy businesses in north america and europe continue to
experience tremendous growth . the opportunities to continue to grow our
natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to
enron  , s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets .
it is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of
gas and electricity , which can make significant contributions to our earnings
growth . we have made significant progress in developing these businesses in
north america , europe , and most recently in our new net works business unit .
included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products ,
coal , emissions , insurance , currency , equity trading , interest rates , credit
trading , paper and pulp , and metals .
while significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to
accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to
aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in north america
and europe . in order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize on
the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today
announcing the formation of a new business unit  ) enron global markets . this
new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in
scope , but outside our traditional gas and power markets . this new core
business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with
the north american and european businesses .
enron global markets will be headed by mike mcconnell , president and chief
executive officer , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer . they will
report to mark frevert who will be chairman of enron global markets . mark ,
mike and jeff will comprise the office of the chairman for enron global
markets .
included in this new business unit and reporting to the office of the
chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders :
- global crude and products : john nowlan
- coal : george mcclellan
- currency , equities , interest rate and agricultural trading : gary hickerson
- insurance and weather : jere overdyke
enron  , s metals business and enron credit . com will remain the responsibility
of enron europe . the paper and pulp business will continue to reside in north
america .
with the departure of mike mcconnell from enron net works , we are pleased to
announce the following appointments in that business unit :
- jeff mcmahon : president and chief operating officer
- louise kitchen : chief commercial officer
- philippe bibi : chief technology officer
jeff , louise and philippe , along with greg whalley , will comprise the office
of the chairman for enron net works .
with jeff shankman  , s departure from enron north america  , s natural gas
operation , all of jeff  , s direct reports will report to john lavorato .
we are also pleased to announce the following changes to the enron north
america office of the chairman . john lavorato will join the ena office of
the chairman as chief operating officer . dave delainey will assume the role
of president and chief executive officer . mark frevert will retain his role
as chairman of enron north america in addition to his role as chairman of
both enron global markets and enron europe .

looking for is scheduled on days 1 / 27 - 1 / 31 . i am sure there is no

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the

legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and

we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists .
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

"Subject: re : hpl meter # 980074 bammel hpl d / p to transco
daren - what happened in feb . was that transco had allocated a different
amount other than our measurement . i had been working with fred on getting
some allocations resolved for several different months . transco told us they
would not go back and reallocate due to the statute of limitations ( 6
months ) . february had a significant amount not allocated . we just need a
deal set up so we can write these volumes off . let me know if you have any
more questions .

"Subject: tenaska iv gas
daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and
williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few
items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was
cancelled ) :
1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should
have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )
and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -
230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at
2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .
2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged
$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91
price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at
2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .
i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for
2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment
if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and
increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at
. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .
in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price
is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache
invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at
other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if
enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a
margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant
should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .
looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and
october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from
williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot
prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our
meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of
$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas
delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .
so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their
november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price
differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of
$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of
tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .
month plant gas price amount
november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843
november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )
october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )
nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000
sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52
total $ 484 , 234 . 03
i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before
reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts
that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .

i was skeptical when i ordered your product .
i was a smoker for 32 years and had tried everything . on april 17 th
at 12 : 00 pm , i finished my last cigarette in my last pack . after taking the first 2 pills ,
i have not touched another cigarette . on march 15 , 1991 i turned 35 years old .
6 days later i had a severe heart attack . after in the hospital for 9 days i walked
out and started smoking again . i sat with my dad for a year till he died of lung
cancer in 1997 and i still smoked even as i watched him waste away .
until i started fina lsmoke i felt that within 5 years i ' d be dead and gone .
but now i feel alive again . more energy and even happier than i have been in years .
and i owe it all to you and your great product . you have changed my life forever
and for that i can never repay you . thank you . - ronnie davenport oklahoma city , ok
exactly what i needed . . . this is a great system ! i knew cigarettes were packed
with poisons but i didn ' t know just how many or what kind there were !
the final smoke capsules were the best . every time i lit up a cigarette ,
i threw it away before half of it was smoked , usually only 2 - 3 puffs .
it made me feel sick and nauseous to smoke these poisons !
this is exactly what i needed to help me stop ! i ' ve been trying
to quit for the past 7 years , i tried everything under the sun with no results .
with final smoke i was smoke free in under a month ! - e . okamura , hawaii

for immediate release
june 26 , 2001
espn to launch sidelines network ' s second reality - based series to
premiere with texas a & m football
espn will launch a 13 - episode , prime - time series this fall entitled
sidelines , the network ' s second reality - based title under the espn
original
entertainment ( eoe ) banner . sidelines will document the season of a
prominent team as told through the eyes and ears of the less visible ,
less
celebrated people who are involved with the team . the football aggies
of
texas a & m will be the focus of the series ' premiere episodes to begin
october 5 .
"" coach slocum and i made the decision to be a part of this exciting
venture
with espn , "" texas a & m athletics director wally groff said . "" we couldn ' t
be
more thrilled that espn has chosen texas a & m for this series . the
opportunity espn gave us to showcase this wonderful institution and all
of
its tradition and heritage is something we could not pass up . ""
in a "" docu - drama "" style , the various stories that surround the team will
be
explored through the voices and actions of people whose day - to - day lives
are
directly affected by living in the town and / or going to the school .
players
and coaches will also be visible and heard from in a more peripheral
fashion , but will not be the primary focus .
"" this is a good opportunity for texas a & m university and we ' re delighted
espn decided to feature the football program and some of the people
behind
the scenes , "" head coach r . c . slocum said . "" we look forward to working
with
them . ""
the participants will be drawn from a cross section of people who
reflect
every aspect of the university and college station , texas . they will be
students , faculty , media , local storeowners , mothers , fathers and some
of
the high school seniors who aspire to attend the university .
"" each person has a role to play with the team , as well as a personal
story , ""
said mark shapiro , vice president and general manager , espn original
entertainment . "" sidelines will see each person grow in character as the
season progresses - - a kind of ' soap - umentary . ' we ' ll weave the smaller
personal stories together through the bigger story of the progression
and
fate of the team and its season . ""
sidelines : texas a & m storylines
- - this is the 125 th anniversary of the school ' s founding ( 1876 ) .
- - the community is still very much dealing with the 1999 bonfire
collapse
which tragically killed 12 students almost two years ago . a 90 - year
tradition came to a tumultuous end . dealing with the loss and the
emotional
toll it took on faculty members , students and families will be an
important
part of this series . the bonfire will return in 2002 but will take on a
different form than has been tradition .
- - texas a & m , who lost a wild , snowy independence bowl last year in
overtime
to mississippi state 43 - 41 , will play notre dame ( at home ) , texas ,
oklahoma ,
kansas st and colorado next year . a tough schedule will provide for
great
drama .
- - the school invented the phrase "" 12 th man "" and actually owns the
trademark .
one game , the aggies were low on players and had a student suit up and
stand
ready just in case he was needed . ever since , a student is chosen for
every
home game to suit up and play on the kickoff team .
- - billy pickard is in charge of maintaining the facilities . he ' s been at
the
university for 36 years and was the student trainer for bear bryant ' s
a & m
team . he was actually in junction , texas for bryant ' s infamous grueling
summer camp . the story of it was a best - selling book , the junction boys .
- - at midnight on the friday night before every home game , a ""
30 , 000
fans show up each week for this time - honored tradition .
eoe , the newest franchise of espn programming , will develop a
wide - variety
of branded programming outside of the network ' s traditional event and
sports
news genres . using a collection of vehicles - - game shows , documentaries
or
reality - based shows - it ' s espn ' s goal to broaden its audience by
appealing
to younger and casual sports fans . in addition , the company is
exploring
new ways to connect with consumers by applying these projects across all
platforms of the espn family - television , internet , radio

"Subject: sec information / earnings restatement
today we released additional information about our related party and off - balance sheet transactions . we have made this information available both on our website and in a form 8 - k filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
the information provides further details about :
- - the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholders ' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge ;
- - a restatement of prior years ' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders ' equity , the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications ;
- - the special committee appointed by the enron board of directors to review transactions between enron and related parties ;
- - the ljm limited partnerships , including a discussion of transactions between enron and ljm entities ; and
- - transactions between enron and other enron employees .
this information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec . as our board ' s new special committee continues its review of various matters , we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation , and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate , appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses .
restatement of earnings
based on information that we have recently obtained , enron and its auditors determined that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in enron ' s consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles . as a result , enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 . these restatements have no material effect on enron ' s current financial position . here are some details included in the filing :
net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of joint energy development investments ( jedi ) and chewco beginning in november 1997 , the consolidation of an ljml subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments . enron ' s current assessment indicates that the restatement will include :
- - a reduction of approximately $ 96 million in 1997
- - a reduction of approximately $ 113 million in 1998
- - a reduction of approximately $ 250 million in 1999
- - a reduction of approximately $ 132 million in 2000
- - an increase of approximately $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001
- - an increase of approximately $ 5 million for the second quarter of 2001
- - a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
the consolidation of jedi and chewco also will increase enron ' s debt by approximately $ 711 million in 1997 , $ 561 million in 1998 , $ 685 million in 1999 and $ 628 million in 2000 .
the restatement will have no material impact on enron ' s reported earnings for the nine - month period ending september 2001 .
you can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the form 8 - k filing at .
we will continue to review our strategic , operational and financial position , and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments .",ham

do not have a price of gd + $ 0 . 04 . we have if + $ 0 . 04 . please check this

subject : project hurricane / bridgeline status
here is a quick status and list of to do ' s related to setting up the new j . v .
between enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline
pipeline systems :
summary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the
name of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 %
enron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading
on the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in
the process of being drafted .
enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to
support this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand
that accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps
scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st
floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen
center once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv
will start in early february for march production .
to do ' s :
accounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it
transition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next
monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same
page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks .
pc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my
request . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs .
networks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the
voice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot
is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a
combination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been
requested .
location on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from
facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv .
currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall
cubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall
cubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done .
data conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and
meter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin
trading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump
of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need .
we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need
to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the
system security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know
who else will need access .
interface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada
application : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright
from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two
applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface .
there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s
rtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime
there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything
is merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between
pop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is
complete .
scada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to
enron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to
them via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs
by switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best
done as a part of the scada transition .
accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be
better defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this
process started .
hourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be
billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk
through this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least
initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the
billing for this one customer .
please let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have
my assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached
at 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy",ham

hampden group ( otc : hpng )
current price : 0 . 25
where were you when the following stocks exploded :
scos : exploded from . 39 on september 1 to 1 . 41 close on october 14 .
sior : september lst close of . 24 . blew through the roof as it
passed . 80 on friday .
face it . little stocks can mean big gains for you . this report is
part of a large pr campaign on this stock .
about the company :
the primary objective of hpng is to participate in specialty finance
within the public and private markets . hampden has partnerships
with finance and in surance companies to provide collateral backed
high yield short - term financing .
hampden is a unique finance company that uses new technologies to
help track and protect loan portfolio assets . the use of
sophisticated tracking technology significantly lowers the risk of
high yield lending and allows the company to benefit from unique
situations and under serviced investments . in addition to physical
asset backed lending , hampden grp . will also actively participate
in structured financial contracts with small public companies
through pipe ( private investment public entity ) transactions .
hampden plans to service private and small publicly traded companies
that have a need for short - term working capital and cannot obtain
traditional financing .
hampden ' s business plan provides collateralized financing to
its customers with annualized rates of return greater than 25 % . the
company ' s valuation , financial ratios , executive compensation , exit
strategy , and other management decisions are driven directly from
the business plan . ( source : news announcement 10 / 15 / 04 )
will hpng explode higher as more and more investors become aware of
the stock ? if you think so , you may not want to wait until it is too
late . remember , timing your trade is critical . good luck and happy
trading .

lisa ,
what is involved in changing a product description to include this phrase ? i do have some customers in texas that are legally bound to only trade intrastate gas and they are fearful of trading anything that doesn ' t specifically state that .
since it is probably only a handful of customers , if it is a major production , it may not be worth it , but i wanted to check .

"Subject: pg & e texoma volumes
in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .

in kansas at the opening session of their senate . it
seems prayer still upsets some people .
when minister joe wright was asked to open the new
session of the kansas senate , everyone was expecting
the usual generalities , but this is what they heard :
"" heavenly father , we come before you today to ask
your forgiveness and to seek your direction and
guidance .
we know your word says , "" woe to those who call evil
good "" , but that is exactly what we have done .
we have lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed
our values . we confess that .
we have ridiculed the absolute truth of your word and
called it pluralism .
we have exploited the poor and called it the lottery ,
we have rewarded laziness and called it welfare ,
we have killed our unborn and called it choice ,
we have shot abortionists and called it justifiable ,
we have neglected to discipline our children and
called it building self - esteem ,
we have abused power and called it politics ,
we have coveted our neighbor ' s possessions and called
it ambition ,
we have polluted the air with profanity and
pornography and called it freedom of statement ,
we have ridiculed the time - honored values of our
forefathers and called it enlightenment .
search us , oh , god , and know our hearts today ; cleanse
us from every sin and set us free . guide and bless
these men and women who have been sent to direct us to
the center of your will and to openly ask these things
in the name of your son , the living savior , jesus
christ . "" amen . ! ! ""
the response was immediate . a number of legislators
walked out during the prayer in protest . in 6 short
weeks , central christian church , where rev . wright is
pastor , logged more than 5 , 000 phone calls with only
47 of those calls responding negatively . the church
is now receiving international requests for copies of
this prayer from india , africa , and korea .
commentator paul harvey aired this prayer on his radio
program , "" the rest of the story "" , and received a
larger response to this program than any other he has
ever aired . with the lord ' s help , may this prayer
sweep over our nation and wholeheartedly become our
desire so that we again can be called , "" one nation
under god . "" if possible , please pass this prayer on
to your friends . think about this : if you forward
this prayer to everyone on your email list in less
than 30 days it would be heard by the world .
