"Subject: re : lng may 19 decision john , this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions . 1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island project ( please , see point 2 ) . 2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest ( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island transaction . the next step will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 . a few comments on the book design and my view of the project : a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions . the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long - term contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words , we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction . b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension option of 5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for such a long tenor . this is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread and i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread . one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the first 5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side . c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market . d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island deal ( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions . long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail that correlates very well with brent . vince john sherriff 05 / 14 / 2000 01 : 40 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : lauren urquhart / lon / ect @ ect subject : lng may 19 decision vince i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well . anyway with greg moving to his new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the eastern hemishere plus lng . i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for lng and lng ship values . i also understand that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far away ) . anway i understand this is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you please let me know where you stand now ? i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in the next couple of days and if you have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well . look forward to connecting with you vince . john",ham

"" there may be two separate questions to ask here . first , in the context of the current market ( or the market which may develop in the next 1 - 2 years ) , will the metarouter be a commercially viable product ? that is , will it address an actual need in the market , or would it be more cost effective just to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits ? the second question ( our first real technical question ) : is the metarouter technology scalable ? before starting on this project , vince and i will need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are implementing this technology . 3 . aggregation of loads . a recurring question comes from a number of areas such as ip , network storage , and streaming media transport sales : what value can i get form aggregating customers , each of which has some type of stochastic load profile ? giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates to ip transport , but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail . the main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual customer data . i am told that in a few months we will have some more useful history . my understanding is that what will be available will be 5 - minute averages of usage , so we still will not know on a short time scale what the distribution of load looks like . i hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our concerns are at this point . please let me know your thoughts about these topics . i would expect , for instance that question number 1 may not be reasonable as a research project , but might be a question which you would feel comfortable in addressing by giving us your qualitative opinions , maybe in the form of a talk here at enron . again , let me know your thoughts , and i look forward to seeing you again soon . stinson nick bambos on 12 / 20 / 2000 12 : 14 : 40 pm to : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com cc : stinson . gibner @ enron . com subject : stanford project hello vince and stinson , first of all , best wishes for happy holidays ! ! ! ! if you are in the stanford area during the holidays , let ' s get together some time to have dinner . i have formally established the project - thanks again for funding it - and i have also recruited the second phd student . his name is eric cope , and he is a top - notch student , very mature , and entrepreneurial ! we have started working on some interesting problems in this area . i would hope that eric could spend the coming summer at enron to get immersed into the "" problem / opportunity generation environment .

- please correct me or suggest otherwise . shalesh ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort . in addition to his effort with your group , he is presently supporting jean mrha with pricing and standardization for a traded storage maret - - stinson gibner is directly supervising him in this effort . shalesh came to us through referal from david cox - - david discovered him at one of his speaking engagements . shalesh had talked to david about traded storage market development some time last october and david refered shalesh to enron research group . we hired shalesh for general analyst position and now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort . currently , he is our point person ( with stinson or i supervising his effort ) who is supporting jean mrha and you on the subject . kara knop has aproached shalesh with request for some support and shalesh and she are sorting out each other  , s role in this regard . as per my discussion today with david , we need to coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market assessment etc . for this i suggest shalesh and his effort so that all parties involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source . based on david ' s and my assessment of shalesh ' s capabilities , i would like to suggest that the commercial heads use shalesh for his creative thinking , understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for data gathering and simple research effort . we can add other staff as we see the need and as you request them . please respond this e - mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan , so that we can support this effort efficiently and in a scalable manner . kind regards , ravi . a bit about ebs research group john bloomer and richard reichardt have met me and are aware of my role and stinston gibner ' s role in ebs . i lead a team of quantitative professionals via a group we are calling ebs research . this group reports to stinson gibner ( vp ) and vince kaminski ( md and head of enron research ) . stinson and vince are the original founders of enron corp research that has been charged with model development efforts to support enron energy trading and other enron business . enron research is involved in all aspects of enron buinesses ( ees , international , corporate affairs such as fas 133 and other accounting and new product ( derivatives ) development , etc . ) . within ebs research , there serveral professionals supporting kevin howard ( cfo office ) , john griebling , tom gros and jean mrha , david cox ( via boris ) , and the war room . our main area of focus is with jean mrha ( trading ) and john griebling ( optical network design and optimization , etc . ) . we play a key role with john griebling ' s go forward network design and implementation through our responsiblity to provide traffic engineering analysis and modeling effort . -

( note that this is 3 days after their authority expires ) ferc will release its proposed order on 11 / 1 / 2000 based on the results of its 206 investigation of the california wholesale power markets . we don ' t know what they will find or what they will propose . the proposed order will have a 30 day comment period , after which ferc will likely issue a final order . ferc will be accepting oral comments on 11 / 9 / 2000 in washington . enron still has to determine who will provide oral comments . many companies have filed at ferc advocating or opposing a litany of price caps , cost based rates , and market redesign recommendations . it is likely that the price caps approved by the iso board will go into effect . how long they will remain in effect will depend on whether ferc extends the iso price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy . impact of price caps the attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at different gas price levels . we think that this is the highest that markets would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap . it is hard to say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap because we don ' t know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the cap . the assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below . take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000 . calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load , new price cap methodology , and a range of gas prices . divide historical hours into peak and off - peak buckets . calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off - peak hours . for example , we have two years worth of data for the months of january through september . each month has approximately 400 hours . for january through september , we took approximately 800 observations for each month ( 400 from each year ) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual observations . we created a peak table and an off - peak table . the table shows the calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices for each month . this value represents what the month would clear at if each hour cleared at the cap ( based on historic loads ) . while any given hour could be above this value , our calculation estimates the likely monthly average cap value ! the blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current ( 10 / 27 / 2000 nymex ) forward prices . the yellow shading indicates those forward power prices which are in excess of the proposed cap .",ham

"" 2 . debt restructuring - guarantees , but no direct state money davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $ 12 billion in back debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up during a 90 - day forbearance period ( whether that period has been agreed to by all creditors is not something we are clear about right now ) . davis ' idea , as he laid it out in the meeting , is to use the forbearance period to securitize the debts and sell them against the utilities ' forward rate base or by establishing a medium - term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees . in both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to paydown their debt . one of the reasons davis wants to stay close to the $ 50 - $ 55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can pay down this debt . there is a strong chance that davis will agree to use state guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations , but he remains opposed to using direct state money . this frustrates both clinton administration and utility creditors , but davis has not yet shown much flexibility . 3 . eminent domain / reregulation perhaps most frustrating to the washington dc free market crowd at treasury and the white house was the continued comfort davis and his group of political advisers have with "" non - market "" solutions to the energy crisis . although the governor ' s aides actually believe the weapon is more a "" way to force eventual agreement , than an actual solution , "" the talk returns frequently to these non - market mechanisms . "" we have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by the tuesday deadline . if we make no progress . if this thing looks like it will turn into a genuine crisis , then we will use our powers of condemnation and we will re - take the plants and equipment and run them ourselves , "" a close political aide to davis said . "" we will absorb the plants , the transmission lines and the reserved parking places of the executives . the legislature would agree in a second . """,ham

"Subject: california power 1 / 19 / 00 1 . legislation passes - short - term measures , very long - term measures as we said yesterday , sb - 7 x passed the california state senate easily . the bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the department of water and resources until february 2 nd . the department will have $ 400 million available to finance power purchases , but there expectations that these costs could easily rise to $ 1 billion by next week . ab - 1 x has evolved into a longer - term solution and in its current form , would authorize the department of water and resources to enter into long - term contracts ( as opposed to the 15 day contracts in sb - 7 x ) to buy power at a price cap of 5 . 5 cents per kw / h . this legislation is not expected to pass today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week period covered by sb - 7 x , when negotiations between generators , the utilities , and the state are likely to resume . a second piece of legislation under - - sb 6 x - - has created uncertainty in the markets . this legislation will create a california public power authority with bond issuance authority . the uncertainty concerns whether the new authority will address the problem of the $ 12 billion in outstanding debt owed by the utilities . the current text of the legislation focuses only on longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving efficiency . yet the legislation also says "" the authority may issue bonds , exercise power of eminent domain , and enter into joint power agreements and buy , own , and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a project . "" the general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of either issuing bonds to finance past debts , or using eminent domain or the bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a ch . 11 proceeding . 2 . default update 3 . bush as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved",ham

"Subject: re : joe , i have written to pal quilkey to invite christian werner to houston for a week to discuss how much of his research we can use . vince joseph hrgovcic 08 / 01 / 2000 06 : 51 pm to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , mike a roberts / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : vince , i have inquired into christian ' s climate models . it seems to me like a long term project . chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than the australian met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and that they are an "" old boy ' s network "" resistant to new developments , but i don ' t think the same can be said of most other weather services . as far as the nws goes , they run their model on a cray , they have several very talented phd ' s working on it full - time , and even then , they can only get a dozen or so runs per night . in other words , it ' s a huge system . replicating something even close to that will not be an easy task . that being said , i think there are related applications that we could look into . since i ' ve already promised the rac group and the weather desk ' s pjm traders to put together a vector autoregressive model of daily temperatures , i think it makes sense to see if something better than a var model can be put together , perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model christian has . what i have in mind is something that would give us say , up to several dozens of "" possible "" temperature forecasts every morning , which would be calculated using actual climate models ( as opposed to time series models ) . i would not use this as a forecasting tool ( the nws model results would make a far better "" best guess "" ) , but our ensemble could still be used to provide a distribution of temperature scenarios . this ensemble would have several uses : 1 ) we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a more realistic daily v @ r for the weather book ( and eventually interface that with the power desk ' s v @ r calculations ) 2 ) we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to week - ahead cdd and hdd distributions ( for use in our demand swaps ) 3 ) if freese - notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts , e . g . , "" expect the trough to recede "" we could sort through the different monte carlo scenarions , find one in which the trough in question is receding , and use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures corresponding to that scenario . up till now , we haven ' t found a good way of getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean temperature - wise 4 ) we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns . the traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen ; although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating month - ahead or season - ahead weather ( trust me on this ) we could still use the visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations . just today , i ' ve spoken with dr . jacobsen of stanford university , who has written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting , and who worked with ucla ' s general circulation model . he says that getting a simplified version of mm 5 ( which is itself a simplified , limited - area version of the gcm models that nws , cola , and ucla use ) would take several months to implement , assuming the people involved are already well versed in the technology . also , i have contacted aer , a massachusetts - based weather consulting firm , and they tell me that they have a mm 5 model running daily ( only one run per night ) , and also some smaller pc models up and running . they are of course willing to work with us for a fee . their mm 5 version runs on a $ 200 , 000 parallel processor . i am open to your suggestions ( or objections as the case may be ) . i ' m not sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of enron , and not just the weather desk . i am scheduled to go to boston next week anyway , and would like to use the opportunity to visit with aer . i will of course coordinate any projects with christian ( if we get something like this up and running it will be more likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own australian model ) . joe",ham

i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style . many thanks and best regards . chris . 2 overview of this book this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book . in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corporation , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . this chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail the methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . examples from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility . chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . what we do in this chapter chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options . chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps . chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style options . chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also discussed . chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .",ham

"Subject: re : hello from vince kaminski at enron vince , thank you for forwarding the following messages . i am sorry that i am just now getting back to you , my lotus notes was down all afternoon yesterday . we currently have the cal berkeley general presentation set for wednesday , october 18 th at 7 : 00 p . m . which works out well because it is just prior to the time deadline for students to submit their resumes . the general presentation is a general overview of enron , the program , the interview process , as well as a chance for students to meet and chat with enron reps . since this is the first year that we are recruiting from cal berkeley , i think that it is important that i attend this event on campus so that i can answer any interview process questions . i will check the schedule and see if it is possible to move the presentation to the 23 rd . the only negative is that i will not be able to attend because i will be conducting interviews at rice that day . also , it is very difficult to find a location to hold the presentation , and i need to check on location availability on the 23 rd . however , i do think that we should take advantage of the seminar on campus . this may mean that they are two seperate trips to campus . perhaps , we can also set up some other presentations for the 23 rd or even the monday prior . although i would like to be able to attend the class / seminar presentations , i don ' t think that it is as vital as the general presentation . what are your thoughts ? thanks , ashley vince j kaminski @ ect 08 / 24 / 2000 08 : 58 am to : "" shmuel oren "" cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , ashley baxter / corp / enron @ enron subject : re : hello from vince kaminski at enron shmuel , thanks for the message . i am working with our recruiter , ashley baxter , to finalize the date of the trip . i shall shoot for october the 23 rd if this date works for the rest of our team . vince "" shmuel oren "" on 08 / 23 / 2000 11 : 46 : 19 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : hello from vince kaminski at enron dear vince . i sent you a reply earlier this month but i haven ' t heard from you about the date of your visit . our department has a seminar every monday . if you can schedule your visit on a monday i would like to invite you to give a seminar which will be attended by many of our graduate students and faculty and will give you an opportunity to tell them about your program . with sufficient lead - time i can advertise the seminar in the hass school to their financial engineering students . shmuel . shmuel s . oren , professor dept . of industrial engineering and operations research 4117 etcheverry hall university of california berkeley , ca 94720 - 1777 e - mail : oren @ ieor . berkeley . edu phone : ( 510 ) 642 - 1836 or 5484 fax : ( 510 ) 642 - 1403 - - - - - original message - - - - - from : to : ; ; sent : tuesday , august 08 , 2000 10 : 59 am subject : hello from vince kaminski at enron > shmuel , > > i hope you remember me . i visited you together with aram sogomonian , a > good friend of mine , a few years ago . i am currently responsible , among > other things , for recruiting graduates with finance and / or technical > backgrounds at the university of berkeley . i would be glad to give you a > call and talk more about the details of our program . my colleague , > ashleybaxter , from the analyst / associate program at enron would join me > as well . > > i am sending you a copy of the brochure about the analyst / associate > program . > > vince kaminski > > > vincent kaminski > managing director - research > enron corp . > 1400 smith street > room ebl 962 > houston , tx 77002 - 7361 > > phone : ( 713 ) 853 3848 > fax : ( 713 ) 646 2503 > e - mail : vkamins @ enron . com >",ham

"Subject: letter from : daniel kabila letter from : daniel kabila investment offer . dear , in appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source and the choice of your country i wish to introduce myself , i am daniel kabila the son of the late drc president laurent desire kabila of the blessed memory . i know this letter might come to you as a surprise but i honestly do not intend to surprise you . i write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of us $ 12 m ( twelve million united state dollars ) with you . i inherited this money from my mother . this money was got through the smuggling and sales of diamond and timber when my father was the head of state . my mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in the business of diamond and timber since she knows that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege situation . when my father was assassinated on 16 th jan . 01 by one of his bodyguards lt . rashidi kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that wanted to topple him i escaped to sa because of the fear that i might be arrested by my half brother lt . general joseph kabila the present head of state . actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately affected us their children . considering the relationship between sa and my country ' s new government , my mother advised me to leave for sa for security reason , while the funds were deposited with a security company abroad . on getting to there where i have been living since then as a political refugee i am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment . honestly i contacted you because i don ' t want to invest this money in here due to my status here as a political refugee . and moreover i wouldn ' t want to take risk because this money is all that i and my mother is depending on because my half brother has seized all my father ' s assets and money and left i and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at the security company in abroad so that is why i decided that investing this money abroad should be the best investment for me . i will be honored if i can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and i from a hopeless future . and if you agree , i hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 15 % of the total money and annual 5 % of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years . thereafter , the term shall be varied . 5 % for expenses , which may arise during the transaction ( fax and phone bills inclusive ) . when the money is moved into your discrete account , you will be allowed to draw 15 % in your favor , while the remaining 80 % will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and deterrents sectors of the economy in your country which are dividends yielding . whatever your decision is please reach me immediately through my email , and keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family . best regards , daniel kabila",spam

"Subject: california update 3 / 06 / 01 executive summary ? if no comprehensive deal is reached by april 9 th , chances of bankruptcy increase due to a one day "" opt - out "" clause in all long - term power contracts . ? pg & e and state locked in tough negotiations , several issues on the table : puc - imposed requirement forcing pg state - 2 . 3 times book value vs . pg & e - 4 times book value ? pg & e will not use any of the $ 1 b secured last week to help their ailing utility . ? davis ' s announcement of long term power contract didn ' t include some details : of the 8 , 800 megawatts secured this far , only 6 , 000 are available this summer some of the "" long term contracts "" are really only for three months none of the contracts prevent california from buying peak demand on the spot market ? one the same day davis announced long term contracts , davis also quietly announce a 10 % rate hike . ? ferc may be the wild card in approving this deal . pg & e transmissions deal one thing that is still uncertain is pg & e . bankruptcy may still be a likely alternative if current negotiations to buy pg & e ' s share of the electric transmission grid fail to produce a deal by april 9 ( when all long - term power contracts being negotiated have a one - day "" opt - out "" clause they can exercise unilaterally if a "" comprehensive solution "" has not been reached by the state and its major utilities ) . according to sources close to senior pg & e officials , pg & e made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the california government ' s willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now . pg & e will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless davis agrees to relieve it of the puc - imposed requirement to be the "" electricity buyer of last resort . "" current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all times to supply california ' s energy needs . as long as the state steps in and makes those purchases , as it has for the past three months , the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings . but , pg & e officials are worried 1 ) this summer ' s supply and 2 ) davis ' s concern over how fast he is draining the state ' s budget surplus . if things get into a crunch this summer and davis makes a new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity it buys through long - term contracts , then pg & e will be left holding the bag . thus , as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid , pg & e is demanding a "" comprehensive solution "" that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed to pay . state officials are in no mood to grant that kind of "" get out of jail free "" card , so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough negotiations that are complicated by three other factors : ( 1 ) pg ( 2 ) state legislative demands that the price davis negotiate for pg and ( 3 ) the ferc must "" positively approve "" any grid purchase by the state of california . the principal concern on the price front is that pg & e wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission , while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit . "" we see 2 . 3 times book value as an absolute upper bound . there is no way pg & e will get more than that , whatever they think , "" according to the leader of one main consumer groups . "" we are going to try to force any deals down to about 2 . 0 in any case . "" negotiators for davis are also trying to ' proposition - proof ' any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal . they think there are ways to do that , but not if the price of pg & e ' s part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative . remember , if davis ' s eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative , he will be running for re - election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution . on the sacramento front - no one understands pg & e ' s motives the one question no one in sacramento can figure out is what kind of game pg & e is playing . in a three day period pg & e made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads . ? late thursday , pg & e officials leaked information to california papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state , which seemed like obvious good news , but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30 % above what the state was currently offering . while a deal can still be done , anything like the $ 10 billion pg & e wants would be very hard to get through the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase . ? late friday , pg & e officials announced that they had secured a $ 1 billion loan for the parent company ( not the electricity utility ) and would use the money to pay off bondholders , other creditors and to return $ 161 million to shareholders in a new dividend payout . not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of pg & e and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood . ? over the weekend , pg & e leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers ' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now . for generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will "" make them whole "" in a couple of months , that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving . thus , in a very short time period , pg & e ' s corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis . davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the $ 13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and pg & e ' s fund - raising will harden and deepen those demands . as one senior political official told our source "" just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible , they come up with something even more outrageous . "" pg and some of these "" long - term contracts "" are actually only good for three months . none of these contracts , however , keep california from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market . davis agrees on new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year while the media was concern with davis ' s announcement of long term contracts for california , of less concern to the media was davis ' s quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers . the state will accept the 10 % emergency surcharge levied on consumers in january as a permanent increase as well as an additional 10 % increase for consumers that will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires . that would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour . ferc the other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the federal energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote . senior california officials and legislators doubt that ferc has jurisdiction , and believe that ferc would not dare stop a deal . but they may be wrong . "" the deal can only go through if ferc specifically signs off on the deal . its power over transmission deal is absolute , no matter what anyone says , "" according to source close to the president . there are three possibilities : 1 ) ferc could "" pocket veto "" it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion ; 2 ) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down . the democrat on the commission , william massey , has already said he is opposed to it ; or 3 ) the commission could approve it but with condition that davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system . one complicating factor in the ferc decision , however , is that its chairman curt hebert , who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale , may not be around long enough to have his say . "" hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the ferc chairman position , "" says one washington official . two other appointments to the commission will soon be named , this official notes , and one of them "" could easily become chairman .

"Subject: full circle : asps the new big blue ? network world fusion focus : mike jude and nancy meachim on application service providers today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new big blue ? 03 / 15 / 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new big blue ? by mike jude and nancy meachim the terms  & asp  8 and  & ibm  8 may have more in common than being three - letter acronyms . remember big blue of the early  + 60 s ? the vision , then , was centralized computing . mainframe computers hosted complex , expensive applications that end users accessed via dumb terminals . it infrastructure , especially memory , was expensive and needed to be controlled . with computing resources centralized , ibm reasoned , they were easier to maintain . of course , ibm got it wrong , in that computers became a cheap commodity . and users weren  , t happy simply using dumb terminals . they wanted a bigger share in all that technology offered . so , as memory prices fell , so did the idea of central control . dumb terminals were transformed into intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data . the glass house populated by white - smocked technicians went out of fashion . looking back on those times , many of us would shake our heads and wonder how ibm could have been so wrong . but maybe big blue wasn  , t so far off . thanks to the advent of application service providers , centralized computing is making a comeback . asps offer centralized application management . the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy . but asps now host all kinds of applications , including small , multilicensed programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand . but , the principle remains the same : central control makes support much more efficient and usually cheaper . how about that , ibm ? to be fair , the dynamics of an asp are very different from old centralized mainframe operations . an asp doesn  , t just host and support an application for general distribution over an in - house proprietary network . unlike the ibm vision , an asp is very dependent on network service . it is also very sensitive to service levels . in the  + 60 s , if the mainframe let you down , you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an hour or so , and your only recourse was that white - smocked fellow . nowadays , users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a minute . and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation . the world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old  + 60 s shop . however , if one could magically transport a computer user from the  + 60 s to the wonderful new 2000 s , would it seem all that different to him ? in an ideal asp world , a la scott mcnealy  , s vision , users would sit down at a semidumb terminal , download the application du jour , and start working . what did the  + 60 s user do ? kind of the same thing ! so you are probably wondering , what is the point ? just this : ibm  , s problem was leaving the customer out of the equation . and look what happened . customers rebelled . they didn  , t buy ibm  , s spiel . it became the  & in  8 thing to hate ibm . why ? because the guys in white smocks couldn  , t spell service and didn  , t care about customers . to be successful , asps need to learn from the past . they need to tattoo service on the forehead of each of their employees . there are too many choices , today , for customers to put up with inferior service . that  , s one big difference from the  + 60 s . customers now can literally choose any service provider in the world . just being big doesn  , t cut it these days . to contact mike jude and nancy meachim : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - senior consultant michael jude and research director nancy meachim are with enterprise management associates in boulder , colo . , ( http : / / www . . com ) , a leading analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise management . jude has over 18 years of experience in the telecommunications industry , most recently with us west , where he was a manager of public policy . mike can be reached at mailto : jude @ . com . meachim focuses on e - business management . she is currently conducting a research study on asp management that is due to be released in april . nancy ' s email address is mailto : meachim @ . com . for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page : http : / / www . nwfusion . com buzz : application otsourcing , network world fusion , 09 / 27 / 99 asp research page , network world all about asps information center for application service providers , their customers and delivery partners . includes resources , events and news . the asp industry consortium . http : / / www . aspindustry . org / subscription services to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters , go to : to change your email address , go to : subscription questions ?

"Subject: re : the consultant ' s model for gary hickerson ' s group the model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of power plants of gencos . it is to give trader a better insight as to whether the market is overvaluing / undervaluing certain genco stocks , and trader can act accordingly . i ' m still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use it . modeling details : the model takes in all gencos ' locational power forward prices and fuel forward prices , and uses garch model to simulate one year daily prices , and then uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices . garch model parameters are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and are updated twice a year , and it does not matter whether the simulation starts in january or september . using these prices , it will determine whether a unit at a particular location will be dispatched or not depending on a ) spread of power and fuel prices , and b ) whether the start - up cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours . the unit can be dispatched at minimum and peak levels . fixed o & m , sox and nox ( i don ' t know what the last two stand for ) are taken into consideration . with the simulated dispatch schedule , the model calculates the value that can be generated by this unit , then sums it up across all units . the final value is the average of 100 simulations . and it takes about 16 hours to run for about 200 units . after our conversation , the consultant promised to look into a ) how to make the model more flexible , say , to allow a different time horizon , b ) reduce spreadsheet overhead by doing calculation one unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information ( as of now it saves everything on the spreadsheet ) . assuming the garch process is modelled correctly , i believe the methodology is ok , though it does not capture most of the optionality . my concerns are : whether the price processes are modelled correctly . i have to get more details before making any conclusion . 100 simulations are way too few . unless we convert the algorithm to c , i don ' t see how spreadsheet can handle more simulations . i guess that ' s why they contact us . but again , if enron ' s buying the model from the consulting company , why should enron do their job for them ? how trader ' s going to use the model output . for this i phoned jeff ( the associate who initiated all these ) and am still waiting for his returning call . a related questions why the model horizon is one year . we can either oversee the conversation , but not doing actual coding for them . or redo the model for them . ( the problem still remains that how trader ' s going to use the output ) . but in view of the great wall of china separating the business units , should we do it ? as of now i have a simulation model taking start - up cost , fixed o & m , rump - up delay into consideration . it simulates monthly prices ( using gbm ) and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run 10 , 000 simulations for one unit for ten years ( 120 time steps ) . it can use forward - forward vol and incorporate seasonality into it ( i understand this is debatable ) . ( one interesting observation is that when using forward - forward vol simulation , the standard deviation is about 0 . 5 % , while standard deviation using forward vol is about 2 % . also , incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1 . 6 % ) . since most of the time - cost occurs in price simulation , and we are to simulate about 20 price processes , i hope the full model ( if we build it ) will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units . the main task will be interfacing , i . e . , getting data from data base , and outputting the results . this is where i need most help if i am to do it . please advice the course of action . i am supposed to talk to michelle cisneros today . p . s . i never promised to oversee a programmer in our group ( see the message below ) . best , alex - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by alex huang / corp / enron on 01 / 05 / 2001 08 : 58 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jeff m gray 01 / 04 / 2001 to : gary . hickerson @ enron . com , michael . w . bradley @ enron . com , michelle . d . cisneros @ enron . com , jaime . gualy @ enron . com cc : alex . huang @ enron . com , kskinner @ ftenergy . com , cseiple @ ftenergy . com subject : fw : project timeline ken and i worked up the following timeline and refined the trading methodology a bit this morning . we also met with alex huang from vince ' s group , and explained the model and coding tasks . ken and alex have arranged to speak by phone on monday , and meanwhile alex is coordinating within the research group . alex will oversee a programmer within his group , while interfacing regularly with us . 1 / 4 kickoff 1 / 11 complete spreadsheet , table , and database structures ( rdi ) . 1 / 17 complete software coding for the pricemaker component of the model ( rdi and enron research ) , and begin testing ( enron research ) . 1 / 22 complete software coding for the dispatch portion of the model ( rdi and enron research ) , and begin testing ( enron research ) . 1 / 22 complete financial trader "" user "" interface , within the access environment ( rdi ) . 1 / 22 complete collection and delivery of unverified generating - unit data from rdi databases ( rdi ) . begin verification process ( rdi ) . 1 / 29 complete all charts and reports accessible from the user interface ( rdi ) . 1 / 29 complete compilation of consensus ebitda forecasts for all operations other than merchant generation ( enron financial trading ) . 2 / 9 complete code testing ( enron research ) . 2 / 9 deliver verified and quality - checked generating - unit data ( rdi ) . 2 / 9 complete the model , begin testing the trading methodology , and train users . 2 / 16 finish training , testing , and final qc . jeff",ham

"Subject: re : working gas price model vince - i have a simplified version of brad ' s model in mind . the "" no arbitrage "" condition equates trading margins across the country . costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network . wellhead supply is almost completely price - elastic , while burner - tip demand is almost completely price inelastic . storage is rationalized as a perpetual call option . the least time - variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing gas from storage to the pipeline , followed by the costs of delivering gas from the wellhead to the pipeline . the intermediate - variant parameters are the capacity - dependent costs paid to the pipeline ( above shrinkage ) for transmission . the most time - variant parameters are the trading margins and the valuations of the storage option . there are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork . they are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways : using a short time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability mentioned above , or point - estimates ( "" calibrations "" ) using only today ' s data based on a node - based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with the same region of origination , albeit markedly different terminus , price versus capacity similarly , "" competing "" for outflows . i will write this up for you in scientific word and present it to you at your earliest convenience . clayton",ham

"Subject: linear programming software purchase vince , i ' d like to purchase some copies of the xpress lp solver for the gas storage optimization model . we have previously discussed the purchase of cplex , but after trialing both systems , have found some worthwhile advantages with xpress . if others find planner / cplex best suited to their application , i see no problem is their use of a different system - both have strengths , and it is likely that i would use planner / cplex myself on some future project if we were to have both systems available . xpress is particularly suited to my application because it handles special ordered sets . this is a very efficient way of representing the storage ratchets as the integer search process is able to use the extra information provided by the set , rather than just using binary integer variables to represent the ratchets . planner is a c + + interface for cplex . it has some significant limitations , and does not permit access to all cplex features . dash optimization have made the following offer : all software purchases made by enron this year will be at 30 % off the list price - we do not need to make a single purchase of any specific quantity of licenses to obtain this discount . 90 days of full maintenance services will be provided with the purchase . the emosl utility will be provided at no cost . the xbsl system will be provided at no cost when it is released in a few weeks time . for the gas storage optimization model , i would like to purchase : one development license , hyper version , with modeller , primal / dual simplex , mip search , dlls , emosl and xbsl when available . list price $ 10 , 000 discounted price $ 7 , 000 two run time licenses for above , list price total $ 8 , 000 discounted price $ 5 , 600 total cost $ 12 , 600 i ' ve used the usually security request system to set the purchase process going , should you agree to this . tom .",ham

( of course , because of the $ 15 , 000 / year limit , i have to spread my gifts over several years in order to get the total amount matched by enron . ) sherry benton , the librarian in spearman just called and gave me the great news that the $ 20 , 000 in community donations has been achieved . in fact , i expect that the total community number will come to almost $ 25 , 000 once all of the donations are received . in order to recognize our part in all this , the mayor of the town is planning to declare october 17 th as "" stinson gibner and enron day "" in spearman , and they would like to have some public ceremony to bestow this recognition . there will be coverage by the local radio station and newspaper and , possibly , by the amarillo newspaper as well . they are asking if a representative from enron ( other than myself ) would be interested in coming to spearman for this event . please let me know if you or anyone else would be interested in doing this . spearman is about a 90 minute drive north from the airport in amarillo , and it is possible to get there and back to houston on the same day . thanks , stinson gibner x 34748 p . s . is there any possibility of getting a one time raise on the $ 15 , 000 / year matching cap so that i can have $ 40 , 000 matched in just two years instead of three ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by stinson gibner / hou / ect on 09 / 20 / 2000 02 : 01 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - stinson gibner 05 / 05 / 2000 11 : 47 am to : cindy olson / corp / enron @ enron cc : subject : thanks cindy , i just received notification of enron ' s match of my $ 8000 donation to the hansford county library in spearman , texas . ( all old pipeline hands know spearman because both northern natural and transwestern pipelines run near by the city . ) you may be interested to know what i am trying to accomplish there . the library is one of the few independent public libraries in the state of texas as it is owned neither by the county nor city . it ' s budget is met through a combination of city , county , and private contributions . a big part of their income comes from the "" thrift shop , "" spearman ' s version of the blue bird circle . in order to help the library continue to provide quality services to the community ( our library in spearman , population 3000 , is by all accounts much better than the one in nearby perryton , population 15000 ) , i am trying to help the library establish an endowment fund . we have set a goal of raising $ 100 , 000 over the next 3 years . with enron ' s matching , i am planning to provide about $ 80 , 000 of that amount with the other $ 20 , 000 coming from contributions from others in the local community . i am also investigating if the library can get any type of matching grant from other foundations , but it looks like most prefer to fund specific projects rather than put funds towards endowments . let me know if you have any suggestions for us . thanks , stinson x 34748",ham

"Subject: jcc good morning . i apologize for the response delay . i ' ve gone back through the analysis that i did back in april , and have thrown around some ideas with vince and stinson . the issue may be summarized as follows . the hedge relationship was derived using jcc and prompt brent , and is valid for jcc and prompt brent . no problems here . however , it will not be valid for points far out on the forward curve . intuitively , this hedge relationship will approach one as we move far out on the curve , but since there is no data , i can not statistically determine this . one can imagine a term structure of heding ratios that start at 0 . 67 and move to 1 . 0 , so that the back end of the curves would move together , but how fast it converges to one is anyone ' s guess . if there is a way of determining the historical jcc forward curve , then the hedge relationships may be estimated . however , i have been unable to determine a rigorous approach to building the jcc curve . i can explain this far better in person , and would like to talk as soon as possible at your convenience . - kevin kindall",ham

"" publish on caida web pages appendix a : questions from the earlier draft caida wg charters a . what types of network - and transport - layer metrics are being used by isps in engineering and operating their networks ? by customers for verifying service guarantees ? b . what new services are being ( or are likely to be ) offered , e . g . diffserv ? is there a need for higher - layer metrics to better monitor and manage these services ? c . will these new differentiated transport - and application - layer services need new metrics ? d . how can the service metrics be measured in a multi - isp environment ? e . how can customers verify these measurements ? f . what requirements would service measurement introduce for equipment vendors ? g . how relevant are specific techniques ( e . g . which flow ) and points of measurement to specific users ( isp , customer , etc . ) requirements ? h . how do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived by users ? how do they correlate with performance ? appendix b : background on the ietf working groups * rtfm wg : realtime traffic flow measurement rtfm is concerned with passive measurements of two - way traffic flows , specified in terms of their end - point attributes . its primary goal was to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the following needs : a . wider range of measurable quantities , e . g . those relating to ipv 6 , and to class of service b . simpler ways to specify flows of interest c . better ways to control access to measured flow data d . strong focus on data reduction capabilities e . efficient hardware implementation * ippm wg : ip performance measurement the ippm wg charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can be applied to the quality , performance , and reliability of internet data delivery services . these metrics will be designed such that they can be performed by network operators , end users , or independent testing groups . it is important that the metrics not represent a value judgement ( i . e . define "" good "" and "" bad "" ) , but rather provide unbiased quantitative measures of performance . rfcs framework for ip performance metrics ( rfc 2330 ) metrics : connectivity ( rfc 2678 ) , one - way delay ( rfc 2679 ) , one - way packet loss ( rfc 2680 ) round - trip delay ( rfc 2681 ) i - ds bulk transfer capacity ( 2 x ) instantaneous packet delay variation one - way loss patterns * other wgs the rmonmib wg is thinking about ' application performance measurement . ' this is clearly a hard problem ( e . g . does this just mean response - time measurement , can it be done by passive means , how should the measurements be presented , etc . ) . in short - rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic volumes - ippm has concentrated on transport - layer behaviour of the current , best - effort internet . - rmonmib is beginning to consider application - layer measurement",ham

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting , asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining . ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials , credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets enron has been moving into over the last few years . on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room . i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me . as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 , may 3 / 4 are good for me . regards nalin at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote : > hi , > > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr . > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options , > etc . > > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems . > > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about > the following : > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) . > > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect > to telecoms , broadband , etc . > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc . > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc . > > > > > look forward to hearing from you . > > regards , > iris",ham

"Subject: var david , during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations . mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system : we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves . we have agreed on the following : 1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run . 2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates . 3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions . this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ; cooperation of trading and rac will be critical . vince",ham

"Subject: various market data charges to the research group for february 2001 clifford : in reviewing our february eis billing summary for co # 0413 , cc # 107043 , i have several questions . telerate : ( february charges : $ 3 , 032 , 35 ) i polled the group and only one person has asked for telerate and he is not shown being charged for it . that is jason sokolov . he would like to have access to telerate . if you could let me know how to get that for him . the largest percent of the telerate charges appear to be for maureen raymond , who says that she does not use telerate . could she be accessing some data that she does not know is telerate ? please let me know . if there are individual accounts for telerate the only one we need is for jason sokolov , unless maureen ' s charges are for something that she does not know is telerate . tanya tamarchenko does not need telerate and she has the second largest percentage of the charges . anyway , the only telerate subscription we need is for jason sokolov . reuters : ( february charges : $ 405 . 96 ) no one in research uses reuters . i believe most of the charges are for hector campos who used it when he was on the trading desk . when he rotated into the research group he did not need it any longer , but is still being billed for it . please remove from the research cost center . the following individuals are no longer with enron or no longer with research and their accounts should be removed from the research cost center . clayton vernon no longer with the research group remove his lim / lim / excel and lim core charges from the research cost center brad amoine no longer with enron remove his lim / lim / excel and lim core charges from the research cost center shalesh ganjoo no longer with the research group remove his lim and lim core charges from the research cost center i hope this is not too confusing ! please advise . thanks ! shirley crenshaw",ham

( by taking demand from our competitors ) . i believe , at the moment , there are no bandwidth exchanges that allow "" combinatorial "" bids . if we are the first one to do it , we might improve our sale channel and gain some market share . ( note : auction - > one seller and many buyers : exchange - > many sellers and many buyers . ) moreover , i think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we cannot sell them anyway . in addition , we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in the system and bid in the auction . if the current wining bid is too low , we can just over - bid it and keep the product . this way , we can indirectly put a reserve price on the products . let ' s meet sometime in the first week of january . - chonawee",ham

"Subject: re : pricing credit on thousands of names we can continue the discussion in tuesday ' s conference call , but i discussed with ben about the issues below , and here are some thoughts . this is not a complete approach , but only a starting point for discussion . the main task is to build a pricing system for many names . this has two components - - - 1 ) how to price a single name ? 1 . 1 ) how to price a liquid single name ? 1 . 2 ) how to price an illiquid single name ? 2 ) how to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names ? the approach i would take for 1 . 1 is a ) define a small set of liquid names b ) apply each of the different models we have , say , the six models ben has mentioned below , to these names c ) include market prices , if any , for these names d ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each liquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b ) and ( c ) e ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models f ) quantify these attributes , if possible g ) try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process , and see if the decisions in the last round still make sense the approach for 1 . 2 may be a ) define a small set of illiquid names b ) apply each of the different models we have to these names c ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each illiquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b ) d ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models e ) check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names f ) define a master set of liquid names g ) look for relationships ( by analyzing cross - section of data ) between attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names and their attributes , then this mapping can be entered into a table , and the pricing can be automated for all names ( in theory ) ! the success will depend on the success of the round - table sessions for the approaches for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 . building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task , but we can get going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any new models that we may build . new models can be added to the suite of existing models . i do not believe there will ever be a single model that will answer all questions for all names , but rather we can refine the mappings and relative choices among models over time , which would mean continuing round - table sessions with traders . limited data makes calibration very hard , so i would continually ask the question "" what do we calibrate ? "" throughout the discussions for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 , and this may help guide us to new models . vasant benjamin parsons 06 / 19 / 2000 04 : 11 am to : ect london credit trading cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , amitava dhar / corp / enron @ enron , steven leppard / lon / ect @ ect , grant masson / hou / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , jitendra j patel / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect subject : pricing credit on thousands of names all - our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] . most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information , making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective . currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under development : fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology . fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding differences . bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs , but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches . under testing . bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer , the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve , then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing . market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap prices . kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next . each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia , capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing system . our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights . the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc . the key steps to implementing such a system will be : establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to , which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping from rating / score to price . getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the model . building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and software packages to use ? determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the model . getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present such a price exists for very few credits . allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would take 6 - 10 man - months to develop . further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' . regards ben",ham

"Subject: re : short - sell vs exercise chonawee , as i have pointed out , short - selling the stock may be a bad decision because of tax implications ( ignoring the legal aspects ) . suppose the strike is $ 70 and you were granted an atm option . you sell short at $ 70 ten lots ( one lot = 100 shares ) . the price goes to $ 100 . you lose $ 30 x 1000 = $ 30 , 000 on your short position . option exercise gives you $ 30 , 000 . this is before taxes . you pay taxes on your option income ( it ' s treated as ordinary income ) . the tax is 28 % x $ 30 , 000 = $ 8 , 400 . you can use only $ 3 , 000 of your loss against ordinary income . this saves you only $ 840 in taxes . of course , if you have capital gains , you can use losses on your option position as an offset . the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time ( less the time value of money ) , assuming you have income in the future ( or capital gains ) . not so good . by the way , valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem . vince chonawee supatgiat @ enron 07 / 10 / 2000 11 : 40 am to : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : short - sell vs exercise below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere . it explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised but cannot be sold . ( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - ) - chonawee short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your exercise . however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up , you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the options to cover your short position anytime . let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends , and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as follow if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 , you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position .",ham

"Subject: extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe - cera insight title : extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2184 overview : a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern europe is bringing the region in line with the european union  , s gas directive . this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by 2004  ) 05  * czech republic , estonia , hungary , poland , and slovenia - - and for candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the decade - - bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , romania , and slovakia . in cera  , s view current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an investor  , s point of view . the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the implementation of the eu gas directive during a two - day workshop held by the european commission and the world bank in paris in november . many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy . the results have been mixed , particularly in the utility industries . the 1998 gas directive ( adopted in august 2000 ) now offers a compelling incentive for eu candidate countries to transform their gas industries , while providing a road map to guide them . the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and candidate countries include the following : * legal framework and regulation . the legal framework is the cornerstone of enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe . as a result , in all candidate countries in 1999  ) 2000 energy laws were either updated or newly established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive . regulatory bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country , although issues of staffing , financial autonomy , and independence from political influence are not uniformly resolved . * third - party access ( tpa ) and long - term take - or - pay contracts . all candidate countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition . therefore , all have adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation . although the commission favors regulated tpa , the specific approaches to tpa enforcement in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases . in particular , the implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long - term take - or - pay contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies and somewhat preempt competition . russian gas is for the most part sold to single , traditional state - owned operators that dominate their internal markets . a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant players and the competitive environment . this is made more complicated by their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange for transit rights to west european customers . article 25 of the directive provides for ! a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry . furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the european union . * price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce . this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1 indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame . * unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries . in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly . table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries scheduled for the first wave . * * end * * follow above url for full report . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 !

"" with the engineering procurement and construction contractors ge and equipment suppliers bechtel too in a cautious mode mode , dpc was finding it even more difficult to continue the construction of the project as per the schedules . sources said the stand taken by the rest of the directors on the board would be in view of the backlash that the company would have to face from its shareholders if the project actually flopped . enron had similar bitter experiences in pakistan and it was difficult for the parent company to then justify such investments to the shareholders . enron , which had planned a major investments in india ' s infrastructure sectors such as oil and gas , lng , gas transportation , telecom and broadband network , has already pulled out most of their personnel from some of these operations . the company ' s mous with various other majors like indian oil corporation , too , is in a limbo and the us major ' s stake in the oil and gas venture is up for grabs . however , even though lay is still hoping to find a solution to the controversy back home , both dpc and mseb are still to get down to negotiations . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the economic times , may 7 , 2001 maha sore over delay in naming godbole nominee the maharashtra government has expressed ' unhappiness ' over the centre ' s delay in appointing its nominee on the nine - member godbole committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement signed between enron - promoted dabhol power company and state electricity board .

"" in last november itself , mseb had sent an official intimation to the state government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two projects on several grounds - - including they being unviable and unaffordable , "" sources said . "" reliance ' s project is no different from that of dpc ' s . patalganga is also naphtha - based and its ppa is on similar lines . . . after the enron experience , mseb cannot even dream of another gas - based power plant in the state , "" a senior mseb official said . he said mseb has already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the 447 - mw patalganga and the 1 , 084 - mw coal - based bhadravati , "" as the us energy major has almost squeezed us of all over finances "" . when contacted , mseb chairman vinay bansal said : "" reliance and ispat projects have been put on hold as per the godbole committee ' s recommendations "" , but expressed inability to give further details . currently , bhadravati and patalganga projects have been put on hold as per godbole committee report , which was set up to review the dpc - mseb ppa and energy scenario in maharashtra . "" can you go ahead with the project without an escrow cover ? "" the committee was believed to have asked ispat and reliance representatives , to which the reply had been negative , sources added . sources said , as of now , both the projects have not been able to achieve financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to fund the projects which do not have a "" guaranteed payment "" mechanism from mseb , which , incidentally it has promised to dpc .

"" ten days have passed since the lenders bought three weeks time from the company delaying its declaration of the termination of the ppa . since then , nothing has moved at the material level barring mseb ' s payment of the january bill to the tune of rs 134 crore under protest , "" said a source among the global arrangers . come forward to meet its obligations the lenders are planning to meet around mid - may in london and this time they will be left with no choice but to give the go - ahead to the company to terminate the ppa unless the finance ministry comes forward to settle the issue , the source added . the lenders are , however , not ready to take the blame for any delay in the termination of ppa as implied by the company . the white & case statement said the lenders are concerned about the fate of the project and they are exploring all intermediate steps before choosing the last option - - termination of ppa . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - business standard , saturday , 5 may , 2001 ge may pull out as dpc supplier , s ravindran in mumbai after us - based bechtel , it is now the turn of general electric to review its participation as equipment supplier to the controversial 2 , 184 - mw power project in maharashtra , being set up by the dabhol power company . bechtel is the epc contractor to the project while ge has supplied the equipment , primarily turbines . general electric , like bechtel , also holds 10 per cent in dabhol power company ( dpc ) . and both bechtel and general electric are worried about future payments from dpc . sources familiar with the project said that so far dpc has not defaulted in its payments to general electric . what is worrying general electric is the possible scenario after june 7 , when about 700 mw power will be commissioned after the second phase trial runs . dpc and the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have been locked in a payments dispute for months . if mseb continues with its stance , dpc in turn may not be able to pay general electric . in such a situation , ge may walk out of the project . a final decision will be taken only in june , said sources . general electric did not respond to a faxed questionnaire sent by business standard . senior executives at its public relations agency burson marsteller roger pereira said that only dpc executives were authorised to speak on the issue . the dpc spokesman declined to comment on the issue . the first phase of the 740 mw has already been commissioned . after the second phase of 1 , 444 mwis commissioned by december , 2001 , mseb will have to pay dpc a minimum of rs 500 crore per month . the escrow account for this was to have been made operational by april 7 , 2001 . mseb has refused to do this . earlier , dpc had invoked the political force majeure clause in its contract with the board . mseb is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has absolved dpc of all its liabilities . consequently , it will not operationalise the escrow account . this casts a further shadow over dpc  , s ability to pay general electric and bechtel . this is worrying the lenders to the project as well . the situation has taken a turn for the worse with dpc practically refusing to re - negotiate the contract for the second phase with the godbole panel constituted by the maharashtra government . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - hindu businessline , may 5 , 2001 agenda for fresh talks with enron chalked out officials of the state government , maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) and members of the madhav godbole committee , which recently submitted its review on the dabhol power project , met here on saturday . the meeting was to ` ` chart the agenda for renegotiation with enron officials , ' ' a senior mseb official said . enron officials were scheduled to attend this meeting but backed out on may 3 . enron had informed the state government that it would not accept the recommendations of the godbole committee . ` it is understandable that the company does not find the recommendations acceptable . but the report is not bound to personal opinions , ' ' the official said . the next meeting to decide the direction of renegotiation process with enron is scheduled on may 11 . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the economic times , may 6 , 2001 godbole panel meets sans dabhol representation the godbole committee , set up for renegotiating the estranged power purchase agreement between us energy major enron - promoted dabhol power company and the state electricity board on saturday held its first internal meeting sans representatives of the multinational .

"Subject: the storage revolution has begun network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today ' s focus : the storage revolution has begun 03 / 07 / 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today ' s focus : the storage revolution has begun by amy larsen decarlo believe the hype . we are in the middle of a storage revolution . virtually overnight , businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to terabytes of data , and the number of users accessing that information is skyrocketing . the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery . it isn  , t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that are changing how businesses handle storage . the premium that companies place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound effect on their storage requirements . businesses demand fault - tolerant storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their employees , suppliers and customers . but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements , on average , double every 12 months , while processor speeds double every 18 months , companies are left with a quandary : how can they manage the proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds ? the simple answer to this question is to institute a well - executed storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support those needs . bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those systems . there are several ways to efficiently manage storage . one of the best routes is consolidation that is , pooling resources and managing storage as a system , as opposed to a decentralized collection of file servers . this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era , when enterprise storage resided on mainframes . but it  , s actually a progressive step , as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing the planning , management , and ongoing support of storage systems than it does with the physical location of the files . next , it is important to recognize that not all information is equally important to the organization . consequently , storage requirements vary by business application . as in all areas of it , it is important to make storage implementation decisions based on business needs . businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for alternatives to the distributed file server storage model . they want to speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth - intensive backup and recovery operations from the lan . network - attached storage ( nas ) supplies it professionals with one answer , giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to stored data . nas devices , which have been widely available for years , are optimized to process i / o transactions . though they promise better performance , they don  , t remove backups from the transport network . instead , they supply a relatively easy - to - deploy solution to cross - platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments . many consider storage - area networks ( san ) to be the best long - term answer to current and future storage challenges . because sans are designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network , they alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated with more traditional storage models . yet , given the early deployment stage most companies are still in , many of those capabilities are still largely untested in a production environment . this newsletter will examine how , through effective storage management , it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery to their customers . this newsletter will not focus on items like the least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library . instead , it will look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues . ultimately , the goal is to identify storage technology options and practices that work in real - world environments . to contact amy larsen decarlo : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - amy larsen decarlo is an analyst with enterprise management associates in boulder , colo . , ( http : / / www . . com ) , a leading analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise management . she focuses on storage management , application management , and security . in her position , she oversees market research and contributes to custom project work in her focal coverage areas . prior to joining ema , amy spent five years covering enterprise management for industry trade magazines , including informationweek and data communications . she can be reached at mailto : decarlo @ . com for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page : http : / / www . nwfusion . com the national storage industry consortium ( nsic ) http : / / www . nsic . org the distributed management task force ( dmtf ) http : / / www . dmtf . org storage systems standards working group of the ieee http : / / www . ssswg . org the ietf http : / / www . ietf . org subscription services to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters , go to : to change your email address , go to : subscription questions ?

"Subject: re : option p & l brad , i was extreamly busy yesterday . sorry for answing your question till now . although i am not exactly sure how the system handle gamma , this is what i think the system is doing : curve shift = today ' s price - yesterady ' s price p / l due to curve shift = today ' s market value using today ' s price curve ( with everything esle the same as yesterday ' s ) - yesterday ' s market value using yesterday ' s price curve . so p / l due to curve shift contains both delta and gamma and higher order terms . we then use theoretical gamma ( meaning option model gamma : 0 . 5 * gamma * ( price change ) 2 ) for gamma contribution and ? define delta = curve shift - theoretical gamma . ? ? therefore , the gamma may not be very accurate to explain the delta change , ? especially when you have big price change due to higher order contribution . ? ? let me know your thoughts on this . ? ? ? best wishes , ? ? zimin ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? brad horn 10 / 12 / 2000 07 : 11 am ? ? to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect ? cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vladimir gorny / hou / ect @ ect , robert ? shiring / hou / ect @ ect , jay knoblauh / hou / ect @ ect ? subject : option p & l ? ? gentleman : ? the erms system , as you know , has an excellent capability for ? decomposing option p & l into the following components : ? ? new deals ? curve shift ? gamma ? vega ? theta ? rho ? drift ? 2 nd order adjustments ? ? what i dont understand is the gamma component which is reported in dollars . ? the unit of measure suggests that incremental changes in a contract position ? is being associated with specific prices . these prices are the effective buy ? or sell prices associated with the dynamic delta position . ? ? stated differently , the standard taylor expansion has incorporated a price ? variable in such a way as to convert the unit of measure from gamma ' s ? standard contract count to total gamma dolalrs . this is something i dont ? understand . to date , inquiries to the risk management accounting group has ? further revealed that the gamma component of p & l is not well understood . ? ? this is what concerns me : bridgeline has 2 books with option exposures ( nymex ? and gas daily ) . both books dynamically hedged its positions during ? yesterdays large price move and , through anticipitory hedging in advance or ? during the large price move , secured sufficient coverage to neutralize ? expected changes in delta . however , our p & l from our underlying position did ? not offset our gamma p & l . consequently , i have to ask why ? im hoping that a ? brief look at the why gamma dollars are calculated may reveal something which ? will better guide our hedging decisions . ? ? any help is appreciated ? ?",ham

"Subject: re : convergence of the research model i was curious about the accuracy of our credit reserve model as a function of the number of simulations we use . this question , i think , is not so important when we calculate credit reserve , because the assumptions underlying our model are pretty rough anyway ( here i mean the assumptions regarding price processes , correlations , etc . ) this question becomes more essential when we talk about calculating sensitivities of the credit reserve to various factors . when the magnitude of the sensitivity is comparable to the accuracy of calculation of the credit reserve , what is the accuracy of such sensitivity ? i performed a numerical experiment where i calculated the expected loss for a simple portfolio with one counterparty ( sithe ind power ) for different number of simulations ( 10 , 100 , 1000 , 10000 , 100000 ) using old research credit model . you can see how the result converges and the relative error ( compared to the result for 100000 simulations which is assumed to be the most accurate ) in the attached file . tanya .",ham

"Subject: wall street ' s dirty little secret . . . it was the spring of 1979 . i was just a tall , goofy looking kid in middle school with buck - teeth and freckles . each day in the cafeteria , i walked from table to table . . . stealing other kids ' lunch money . no , i didn ' t rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made them a little deal . "" let me borrow two dollars today , "" i said , "" and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . "" the investment was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course when "" next week "" rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash , i promised to pay them even more the week after that , if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer . eventually the end of the year came and went , high school started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties , and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money . i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid , and i didn ' t even get beat up . hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn . first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket . second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind . they are looking out for their own money , not yours . the "" professionals "" , those stuffy investment counselors and money managers , will always tell you that the best time to buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make . ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is "" never "" . in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem : do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ? hell no ! you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ? the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich . if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the money . what i ' m talking about here is day trading . my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years he makes money . the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a $ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours , sometimes within minutes . i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started . society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training . the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money . popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty dollars . they make their money only if you believe two lies : 1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person . 2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade . here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely , positively do not want you to know . . . the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying . after reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade , and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons : * * achieving financial success is incredibly simple . * * anyone can do it . * * it only takes a few hours to learn . when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart . buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through hard work , knowledge , and determination . after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk , i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained during those formative trading years i am willing to share with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple , secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably year after year . the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes . the difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge , and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game . average income of a day trader : 5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year 22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year 35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year . 27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year 11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win despite the current market weakness . here is just a snippet of what i will teach you : * * * make money whether a stock goes up or down . * * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds . * * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them . * * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make . * * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market ! * * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success . * * * profit on huge intraday price swings . * * * make money on the biggest news stories . * * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns . * * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street professionals use . * * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind . it ' s time to ask yourself : "" am i going to listen to the professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am i going to take control of my own financial future , and start making money right now in the stock market ? "" who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ? with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with day trading . . . from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars . the master trader e - book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight - forward book ever written about active trading . if you are serious about success in short term stock trading - order today and start paving the road to your own financial future . oh , and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade ? his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market . six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore . in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking for a long - term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5 % a year , then by all means , this ain ' t your kind of game . but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune in the market , with the lowest element of risk , then order the master trader e - book right now . i promise to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading . you don ' t need to know anything about the market , and anyone can do it , with minimum effort . it ' s an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move . order the master trader e - book right now for only $ 49 . 97 by clicking on the link below : http : / / 4 tools 4 life . com / qs our company is strictly opposed to unsolicited emails . to be removed from this list , please send an email to "" bulkexpert @ yahoo . com """,spam

"Subject: just fyi vince , please see below some of the ideas being bounced , fyi . please keep this confidential . the unused capacity in maharashtra should be dispatched on a merchant basis , on behalf of mseb to any customers outside mseb ' s current purview . i would like us to look at the whole issue as one of mseb ' s poor credit , and hence ( as jeff pointed out on the call ) , one where we need to identify all deep pockets in and out of maharashtra . secondly , there is ( as shubh and i had pointed out ) the ability to evacuate about 700 - 1000 mw to customers other than mseb . the challege is - at what price , and in coordination with which agencies . as always , in india your greatest challenge will be in dealing with govt . agencies . another point to consider is that in - all we have about 5 - 7 customers identified . will all the customers we have earmarked bite ? ? ? this is the reason why systems need to be set up with a bulletin board on pricing 10 - 15 day power on the screens of the different sebs we can connect up with . this also substantially gets around the credit quality issue , as this would be an arrangement akin to cash - and - carry . i see a lot of hope for such a strategy . i do not see much hope for a strategy of selling blocks of power to either ntpc or ptc . i would agree however , that we not put all our eggs in one basket , and hence you could designate a team to look into the ntpc sale issue inparallel . in order to set up the trading sytems , however , we need to start by the end of ql 2001 , and just start doing small deals where we break even , simply to test the waters and introduce liquidity into the market . hand - in - hand with this we need a fuel risk management strategy , as i have been pushing for . for this to happen , we need to get the special import licence reinstated . if that is not possible , we need to lobby with the highest authorities within govt . and rbi to allow for hedging , irrespective of whether we have an sil . the discussions being held with ioc are therefore very important in this regard , and i am going to get anshuman and mukesh involved with the same . finally , i do not see much hope for your strategy of asking ene management for $ 75 million to build transmission lines in a country where the regulatory framework on transmission access is even less defined and understood than the generation side of the equation . i would refrain from stating this in any senior management forum until we are able to clearly demonstrate the cost - benefit of this . i have some ideas on that side which i need to develop further . regards , sandeep .",ham

"Subject: latest draft don , attached is my latest effort . it entailed fairly drastic "" restructuring and reorganization "" of the earlier draft . my revision effort has been directed at improving the focus of the paper . the new story is the following : 1 . enron was formed as a regulated gas pipeline company in the mid - eighties . 2 . economic and competitive conditions conspired to force a dramatic reorganization of the company almost immediately . the result was the creation of a new , unregulated energy trading operation . the strategy of the new unit was to capitalize on business opportunities in the deregulation of markets that was occuring at the time ( mid - eighties until now ) . 3 . the business model adopted for the new unregulated business was that of a "" gas bank "" . the analogy to a commercial bank posed a very difficult problem to enron ' s management in that there was no source of liquidity to the market from a central bank authority . as a consequence enron had to develop its own very elaborate risk management procedures . 4 . another consequence of the new business model was that it required a different set of employee skills and talents . specifically , it required were bright , energetic and innovative individuals capable of identifying entrepreneurial opportunities and starting new businesses . furthermore , a new , flatter organizational structure entailing decentralized decision making was required to facilitate quick response to changing market conditions . to monitor and manage this new "" empowered "" labor force required that the firm develop new personnel policies and procedures . 5 . three primary tools of personnel management were adopted : ( i ) measure performance semi - annually , ( ii ) tie compensation closely to performance , and ( iii ) allow personnel free movement within enron to seek out the best opportunities . 6 . other attributes of the enron model include consideration for asset optionality , recognition of the value of networks in adding value to trading platforms , and the use of mark - to - market accounting for business transactions as a means of ensuring transparency and promoting prompt actions . if my "" story line "" sounds better than the draft i have attached its because its the last thing i ' ve written . at any rate i look forward to hearing your comments and to getting this wrapped up . thanks and i look forward to seeing you in february . john - enron _ paper _ 1 _ 26 _ 01 . doc john d . martin carr p . collins chair in finance finance department baylor university po box 98004 waco , tx 76798 254 - 710 - 4473 ( office ) 254 - 710 - 1092 ( fax ) j _ martin @ baylor . edu web : http : / / hsb . baylor . edu / html / martinj / home . html",ham

"" you must never try to send any command to that address , as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed . all commands must be sent to the "" listserv address , "" listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . it is very important to understand the difference between the two , but fortunately it is not complicated . the listserv address is like a fax number that connects you to a machine , whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting you to a person . if you make a mistake and dial the fax number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone , you will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again . no harm will have been done . if on the other hand you accidentally make your fax call someone ' s voice line , the person receiving the call will be inconvenienced , especially if your fax then re - dials every 5 minutes . the fact that most people will eventually connect the fax machine to the voice line to allow the fax to go through and make the calls stop does not mean that you should continue to send faxes to the voice number . people would just get mad at you . it works pretty much the same way with mailing lists , with the difference that you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time , and consequently you can expect a lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address . you may leave the list at any time by sending a "" signoff frbnyrmagl "" command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . you can also tell listserv how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list . if you do not trust the system , send a "" set frbnyrmagl repro "" command and listserv will send you a copy of your own messages , so that you can see that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way . after a while you may find that this is getting annoying , especially if your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from frbnyrmagl . if you send a "" set frbnyrmagl ack norepro "" command , listserv will mail you a short acknowledgement instead , which will look different in your mailbox directory . with most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement you can read later . finally , you can turn off acknowledgements completely with "" set frbnyrmagl noack norepro "" . contributions sent to this list are automatically archived . you can get a list of the available archive files by sending an "" index frbnyrmagl "" command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . you can then order these files with a "" get frbnyrmagl logxxxx "" command , or using listserv ' s database search facilities . send an "" info database "" command for more information on the latter . important : this list is confidential . you should not publicly mention its existence , or forward copies of information you have obtained from it to third parties . please note that the "" give "" command is automatically disabled for all archive files . more information on listserv commands can be found in the listserv reference card , which you can retrieve by sending an "" info refcard "" command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com .",ham
