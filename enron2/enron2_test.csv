"Subject: petrochem desk i had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals . as it turns out , christian left rac in april and joined the petrochem desk as a trader . previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or swags . unfortunately , the group had a rough p & l year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof . when asked about the fundamentals group , christian indicated that they ' d only been around about 3 - 4 months and are not yet well - suited to curve building . john nowlan is indeed the head of the group . from a timing perspective , i told christian that it would probably take at least 6 - 8 weeks to develop a curve , especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers / fundamentals . as was suggested yesterday during our meeting , a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex component ( e . g . , crude oil ) would provide a great beginning point - - we could then potentially strengthen / augment this relationship with other key factors ( e . g . , supply and demand terms ) borne out of our market research . nelson",ham

is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment ? * * this is a good point . i was thinking in terms of the average variance , but this may not be correct . actually , we know that this is just an approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good approximation . typically , firms tend to ignore issues relating to the duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate , which clearly does not make sense . this requires some additional thought . * * 4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines the discount rate . * * this is correct . my goal was to come up with something that was closely related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate . there are a number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure . what we need to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the kind of projects that you are evaluating . * * gas field case to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below . we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of expected production and variance of the production per year is available from the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field to be 10 years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable operating costs . it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this problem . * * this problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing . hence , there is no need to be concerned about risk capital ( other than the x million dollars to buy and develop the property ) . to value the property assuming all - equity financing we calculate the value process of the developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment whose value process is observable ( e . g . , a traded mlp ) . the risk - adjusted return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash flows of the gas field . please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and calculating the risk - adjusted return on the comparison investment is not necessarily straightforward . * * let me know when you would like to discuss this . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * on another topic , is it possible for you to give me information about one case where enron bought or sold a base load power plant , where the purchaser financed the transaction with non - recourse debt . we would like the following information : 1 . the value of the power plant ( or purchase price ) 2 . the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract . 3 . some information about the pricing of gas - power swaps and options . about a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model for project debt . i don ' t think he thought that it could be implemented on the type of projects that enron finances . however , my coauthors would like to try applying the model for one case study . let me know when you want to discuss these issues . thanks , sheridan sheridan titman department of finance college of business administration university of texas austin , texas 78712 - 1179 512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone ) 512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax ) titman @ mail . utexas . edu",ham

"Subject: erisk interview vince : you may inteersted in the following interview which appeared on erisk . com last friday . were rick buy ' s comments about real options taken out of context ? yann bonduelle leads a 25 - person team for in london that applies decision analytics and real options theory to dilemmas ranging from valuing a biotechnology product to deciding whether to kill off an internet financial services business . here he talks to rob jameson about whether this "" theoretical "" approach to risky decision - making really helps businesses in their day - to - day balancing of risk and reward . yann holds a ph . d degree from the engineering - economic systems department at stanford university , where he studied how to apply engineering decision and design analysis to wider economic , social and business issues . he then worked as a consultant applying his decision analysis methodologies to problems that included consumer decision making about innovative products such as electrical vehicles , before joining the team in 1998 where he is now a partner . he has written widely on the application of real options , particularly in fields of life sciences , technology , and e - business , and has a special interest in the relationship between risk assessment , validation of risk data and financial valuation . how would you sum up your approach to business decision analytics ? most of our projects are set up to help businesses that face massive uncertainties of some kind . decision analysis helps people explore problems , and redesign their decision - making process to increase the chance of them making the right choices . for example , imagine a biotechnology company that has to decide whether to put itself up for sale , enter a strategic relationship , or continue to go it alone . each of those options will lead on to other value - enhancing or value - destroying scenarios . we work with the client firstly to understand and challenge the assumptions associated with their most likely business development scenarios , and secondly to help them identify decisions that would help protect or increase the value of their technology or company . quantifying technical , regulatory or commercial risks can sometimes be a challenge . in technology - intensive fields , however , we have found that managers ( often scientists ) are quite willing to describe the main sources of risk and to assess the probability that a risky event may or may not occur . how does this kind of risky decision - making relate to real options valuation ? you can ' t say what the value of an asset is until you decide what you might use it for . this means that , to form an opinion about the value of an asset , you must explore the most important decisions that you are likely to face and that will have a significant impact on the value of the asset . so decision analysis helps to define the business problem and to uncover a stream of inter - related choices that are , in effect , "" real options "" . for example , if a company is trying to decide whether to invest in a risky project , does it have the option to pull the plug on the investment at an early stage if a pilot project gives a poor showing ? that "" real "" option reduces the riskiness , and increases the potential value , of the original business plan . so real options and decision analysis are really very close to one another . but you don ' t have to believe in real options valuations to find decision analysis useful . what do you mean ? often decision analysis can help managers to identify the key risks in a strategic decision , attach weights to these , and show clearly how they interact . for many companies this "" risk discovery "" is the most valuable part of the exercise . real options theory has been criticised recently for being , well , not very realistic . is it a practical approach to valuation ? it ' s important not to hold out unrealistic hopes for the real options approach to valuation . but it ' s an exciting methodology , and it ' s also sometimes the only reasonable way of tackling a very practical problem . for example , when a firm sells an asset , the firm might have to make an independent valuation of the asset for legal or corporate governance reasons . but in many businesses today there are assets that simply cannot be valued in traditional ways because they are difficult to link to cashflows . the cashflows might not exist because the business is so novel , or they might be hidden . in some respects , a real options analysis is much closer to reality than a traditional valuation . how , exactly ? the classic way of valuing a future business is to base the calculation on a single discounted cashflow that is projected from the activity . but this doesn ' t really take account of the way that scenarios can change , or the fact that managers can react to situations as they unfold . i mentioned earlier the option to kill a project or business at an early point . but the upside is that if a pilot project yields exciting results , it might allow you to invest more quickly and reach a revenue - generating position in a much shorter time than the original business plan allows . so to value a future business we really need to look at the cashflows that might arise in a number of scenarios . this is "" realistic "" in that , if the project gets the green light , you can bet that its managers will be taking that kind of decision on the ground all of the time . what ' s the most challenging part of mapping out a decision analysis tree ? modelling the links between the variables in the decision tree - - it ' s something we have particular strengths in . but it ' s also tricky to know when it ' s worthwhile to add on more detail , and when it ' s better to draw back . in a recent erisk interview , rick buy , chief risk officer of enron , said that over the two years that enron had experimented with the real options concept , it had found it of "" limited , but not zero , use "" . why is there a slight air of cynicism about real options in some businesses today ? it ' s strange that enron would profess this attitude . a few years ago , it was widely reported to have used real option valuation to support a very profitable purchase decision . they had apparently bought cheaply some older generators in the us that generated electricity at a very high cost . they knew that they could mothball them for most of the year , and switch them on only when the electricity prices were sufficiently high . nevertheless , from a customer ' s point of view , there might have been too much hype about the methodology . one problem in the application of real options technology is that there are , perhaps , too many people trying to tweak reality to conform to their "" perfect "" model . it ' s better to aim for something pragmatic that clearly improves decisions over time . in one pharmaceutical company we worked with recently , we worked together to improve their valuation analyses by moving from a single discounted cash - flow methodology to one that took into account a rather small set of business scenarios . it would have shocked some academics and consultants , but it was an undeniable improvement on the original approach . why do you think financial institutions are only just picking up on your field , when it ' s been applied in the energy industry for 15 years or more ? it might have something to do with the relative stability of the banking world until recently , and the relatively high margins that banking lines have enjoyed . also , industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals tend to have more people with an engineering and science background . the dynamic modelling of decisions is based on methodologies originally dreamed up to help engineers design electrical and electronic systems . this approach is quite distinct from the black - scholes options analyses that the banking world is familiar with : the black - scholes approach is difficult to apply in a real options context , because everything depends on the assumptions that you put into the black - scholes model . the real options approach , on the other hand , is in a sense a way of modelling those assumptions more explicitly . but banks are now adopting some of the thinking , particularly in terms of using decision analysis to pinpoint risks and identify value - enhancing decisions , and in using real options methodologies to sort the wheat from the chaff in their more speculative investments . you mean their internet investments ? we have recently worked with a major dutch bank that had arrived late in the internet game , and then made a considerable number of investments . now that even b 2 b business models have questions marks hanging over them , and many b 2 c businesses are already under water , they wanted to work out which investments might contain real value . in this situation , it ' s a case of ranking priorities and helping the bank make sense of what could turn into a decision - making chaos , rather than sophisticated valuation . it ' s not just a case of whether an internet investment should be killed off , but the problem of whether continued funding for it should take priority over budget demands for major it upgrades in existing businesses , and so on . these are very practical questions and they have to be answered somehow . are there other areas in financial institutions that seem accessible to this approach ? yes , for example , we think it can help work out the value associated with various approaches to marketing a new bank business line . at the moment , many banks are chasing high - net - worth individuals , but it ' s not always clear which kind of individual a particular bank should decide to pursue . the bank might have a regional or industry advantage already in one particular area , for example , music business people . but what is the churn rate associated with this kind of customer ? what is the profitability associated with the customer segment ? will the time and cost benefits of the advantages the bank has in the sector outweigh any disadvantages ? weighing up this kind of complex problem , where one thing leads to and depends on another , is what decision and real options analysis is good at . is there any way of rigorously backtesting or validating real options valuations ? in all honesty , not really . the problem is that by the time the option is exercised , many of the variables surrounding it will have changed , so it ' s difficult to compare our original analysis with how things turn out . however , the value of the analysis comes not only from the final number ( "" the value of this asset is x "" ) but also from providing a thorough process , an outsider ' s point of view , an understanding of the sources of value and , in short , a bit of clearer thinking . if real options are so important , why are they so rarely cited in communications to shareholders and equity analysts ? the battle is still to convince companies to use real option valuations as a significant part of their internal analysis . even in major companies in the oil & gas , and pharmaceutical sectors , where the ideas have taken some root internally , there seems to be a lot of reluctance to use them in external communication . we are working with analysts to understand better what they need to if we are to move things on to the next step . how does the riskiness of a business , in terms of the major strategic dilemmas it faces , relate to its share value , and its capital structure ? that ' s a big question . it ' s related to work my colleagues do on the optimal debt - to - equity capital structure and gearing of a corporation , which in turn arises out of the likely revenue and cost volatilities of the business . the more volatile the business , the less gearing it can sustain , and the higher the cost of capital . our work touches on this in the sense that exercising ( many ) specific real options can allow a firm to change its nature , and thus also its risk profile . one classic example is the pharmaceutical industry . a host of different kinds of companies service that industry from "" big pharma "" companies through to smaller biotechnology startups and run - of - the - mill contract research organisations . a contract research organisation is often operating within a very competitive environment with relatively few risks - - it does not invest in drug development itself - - but also very thin margins . but in fact , a few of these companies have used the skills and knowledge they have developed to become much more substantial and profitable healthcare companies of various kinds . it ' s an example of a company exercising the real options that lie within its skills and assets to transform its own identity . rob jameson , erisk",ham

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ? recently , we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics . merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest . we decided to find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging , publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months . although ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old . the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno . and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price . after a successful north american launch , gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach . what does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game , one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . . to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more . first source data inc . 4535 west sahara ave # 217 las vegas nevada 89102 disclosure and disclaimer investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first source data , inc .

"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . "" at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist , who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected at this time . although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations , needing no further training and only minimal supervision . once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous . stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion and major upgrade of this web page . these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail , to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations assistance . in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",ham

i ' m not thinking of any preparation , but more of an informal discussion of the "" philosophical issues "" related to real options work . jim - - - - - original message - - - - - from : jim dyer sent : thursday , march 30 , 2000 1 : 24 pm to : ' jclevenger @ optionii . bus . utexas . edu ' subject : re : real options course feedback josh , some very thoughtful observations . as you know , i had invited one finance professor to our class on arundel , but he was out of town . i do plan to invite sheridan titman to discuss the issue of using the option models in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded . i do think it is important to face that issue , which is actually covered at a theoretical level in our last couple of readings . the issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for further discussion , as you suggest . so far , we ' ve been looking at cases where volatility is "" given "" . the problem of finding an "" objective "" measure of volatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correct risk adjusted discount rate , which is not surprising since the concepts are almost two sides of the same plate . one approach , of course , is to do some modeling using traditional decision analysis tools , including subjective probabilities , but the finance people who write options articles don ' t like to think about such ideas . i ' ll try to address these issues in more detail as the semester continues . i think it was important to surface some of these points early , and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a naive sort of way . thanks for the feedback and comments . jim - - - - - original message - - - - - from : jclevenger @ optionii . bus . utexas . edu sent : thursday , march 30 , 2000 8 : 42 am to : jim . dyer @ bus . utexas . edu cc : josh - clevenger @ reliantenergy . com subject : real options course feedback after overcoming the initial ( i hope ) overload of materials and tools presented thus far in the semester , it appears to me that you are achieving the objective of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety of problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded financial elements . as a constructive feedback , you have been forthright with us in marking off areas of this subject which are still controversial . i also realize that rightly so , real - world application of this type of analysis without a robust understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions that result in a "" house of cards "" effect . my opinion at this point is that two issues are of potentially "" make - or - brake "" importance if i am to persuade my superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of projects whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by financial instruments . these issues are easy to guess : 1 ) discounting and risk free rates : i do not sense that anyone in the class has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time value questions in the absence of liquidity . is there someone within the finance department that can present a firmer position on this question ? 2 ) volatility : i found winston ' s examples on this metric succinct . i would recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this subject . my criticism again relates to messy problems . i anticipate arguments against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility measures . if i were a conservative financial manager , i would argue that : * * * two - a : implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of equity options is a shotgun approach - - the projects being valued are of a tranche which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the weighted average measured by the equities utilized . oil , gas and electricty are good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of the value chain . smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata , but what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a vertically integrated company ? * * * two - b : based on the following skepticism - if a real option value is being proposed for a new business venture ( some new unexploited opportunity , ) there is some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new ventures and the high risk of failure . this skepticism is likely to be less acute in high - tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded before us daily by nasdq touts . it is a much harder sell to "" mature "" industries . of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas sectors as regulation is removed . a large proportion of the risk is embedded in ongoing changes of public policy on an international basis . as an intentionally screwed - up example , can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses volatility for u . s . companies investing in seed projects in mexico based on speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility ( cfe ) and pemex ?

"Subject: introduction vince : as way of introduction , i wanted to write a bit about mars inc . and then about cds , the unit i head . mars is a private company , considered to be the largest privately owned manufacturing company in the world . mars is not in the habit of disclosing its finances , so the best i could do is refer to forbes ' estimate of $ 15 billion annual revenue and to the profit margins of similar companies between 5 - 12 % . mars is in the business of manufacturing confectionery ( m & m , dove bar , skittles , twix , - all ( r ) ) food ( uncle ben rice ( r ) ) pet food ( pedigree , whiskas waltham ( r ) ) and other products . mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that emphasizes the long term goals of the company . part of the philosophy is to look for win - win solutions with its suppliers , customers and partners . as can be understood from the nature of the company , a large chunk of its expenses goes towards purchasing commodity like products , and hence the history of researching those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand ( people eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer ) . cds has a history of few decades in forecasting weather and has been very successful , with an envious track record , in helping mars get a competitive advantage in these arenas . cds is a global group ( in 4 countries across two continents ) which supports the purchasing function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas . it is a multidiscipline and multinational team with a lot to offer . not having a ready access to the energy markets , and with a risk profile based on manufacturing expertise , mars has decided to look for potential partners in this area . enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to talk to . in talking to enron , we are careful to suggest that mars is not committing to anything at this point , and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to pursue the opportunity we discussed in the future . i am looking forward to our video conference call . kind regards , avi - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - avi i . hauser phd mba cds director 100 international drive mt olive nj 07828 - 1383 + 1 973 691 3664 ( office ) + 1 973 347 8189 ( fax ) + 1 973 727 3622 ( car + slow paging ) hauser @ cdsusa . com",ham

"Subject: var for metals it is my preference to have an aggregated var methodology for the metals business as soon as possible ( version la ) . i do not want to poison progress with my opiniion , but i think that the critical first step is to find a way to aggregate positions in coarse buckets , perhaps sacrificing precision for speed , based on "" rules "" that oerations can deliver , research can stand behind and commercial will accept . , and using an equally coarse var calculation ( the equivalent of ad - hoc var ? ) that can be delivered to the "" official books and records "" on a daily basis . this i believe would be acceptable for a 2 - 3 month time frame ( at which time we get versionlb ) as opposed to waiting 2 - 3 months to implement a better process and have nothing in the interim . ultimately , i would look for version 2 a to be delivered and very defendable by 1 / 1 / 01 . this will require indulgence and compromise on all fronts but i cannot conceive of a better way . please let me know if this is consistent with your understanding . a critical point from my perspective is that the mg commercial team and metal operations staff understand their role in making this happen and willingness to accept the consequences . i look for you to take the lead as leader of the integration to do so . if you need any input from the rest of us to underscore the importance please let us know . as i alluded to on the phone , the people in houston that have been involved in the var process have been through an extraordinary period of detailed scrutiny of var by commercial and have been hindered by the lack of basic understanding by all parties as their responsibilities . given the distance and the newness of the metals personell , i fear that this could set us all up for some surprises and some very uncomfortable communication , much of which is not entirely necessary . thanks ted eric gadd 07 / 21 / 2000 11 : 46 am to : ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , bjorn hagelmann / hou / ect @ ect cc : richard sage / lon / ect @ ect subject : attached fax ted and bjorn - we plan to release draft recommendations on metal position limits by close of business on 24 july and have asked vince to prepare a v @ r computational methodology prior to the 7 / 8 aug bod meeting .",ham

"Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01 the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion . executive summary : ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal 1 . ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation . it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan . 2 . something less than effective price caps from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws : ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california . ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling . ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion . ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc . 3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse . 4 . growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power . the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california . the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months . 5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline . 6 delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated . 7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge . 8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay .",ham

"Subject: organizational announcement - introducing enron engineering and operational services in order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with the commercial businesses they support , we are pleased to announce the following organizational change will be effective immediately . a new business unit , enron engineering and operational services ( eeos ) , is being formed which will include our existing operations in enron engineering and construction company ( ee & cc ) , operational energy corporation ( oec ) , and national energy production corporation ( nepco ) . brian stanley , as president and chief executive officer , and keith dodson , as chief operating officer will provide the leadership for this new organization , reporting to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . nepco will continue to operate as a stand - alone business under john gillis , president . with the majority of ee & cc and oec  , s activities focused on assets and projects which are in wholesale services , this will better align the efforts of eeos with the commercial businesses it supports . while eeos will be a stand - alone unit within enron wholesale services it will work very closely with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports . this realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation of resources to these projects . consistent with this approach , development engineering will have dual reporting to both eeos and the business units which they support . with an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide variety of new development opportunities available to enron , it is critical that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design , construct , commission , and effectively manage and operate enron  , s assets on a global basis . this new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage as we advance our business strategy around the world . please join us in congratulating brian and keith on their new assignments . mark frevert & dave delainey",ham

"Subject: re : choosing the riskfree rate dear all , i completeley agree with ben that treasuries are the most liquid and reliable benchmarks . i also think that fmas have their own advantages and disadvantages . however , it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using libor as benchmark - at least to price anything related to capital markets ( for example , credit default swaps ) . our prices will always be different from that on capital markets if we use benchmarks different from the market . as a half - way solution we can have different benchmarks - for example , use anything , that we decide is closest to risk - free , to value products significantly different from that priced on capital markets , and libor for everything priced on capital markets . we can adjust by manipulating other coefficients ( event , liquidity , recovery ) for our purposes , but it looks like benchmark should be libor . to avoid negative default probabilites ( for highly rated reference entities ) we can add cost fo repo and haircuts ( as all bankers do ) . let us continue our discussion on this . slava benjamin parsons 13 / 03 / 2000 20 : 07 to : bryan seyfried / lon / ect @ ect , martin mcdermott / lon / ect @ ect , viacheslav danilov / lon / ect @ ect , stuart ffoulkes / lon / ect @ ect , eklavya sareen / lon / ect @ ect , tomas valnek / lon / ect @ ect , john metzler / lon / ect @ ect , simon brooks / lon / ect @ ect , konstantin malinovski / lon / ect @ ect cc : vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , steven leppard / lon / ect @ ect , jitendra patel / lon / ect @ ect , william s bradford / hou / ect @ ect , harry arora / hou / ect @ ect subject : choosing the riskfree rate dear all , following on from the discussions had with vince et al a few weeks ago , regarding the problems inherent in using treasuries as our benchmark riskfree curve , i ' ve written the attached short document . my preliminary conclusions are as follows : recent turmoil in the treasury market mostly hit 10 and 30 - year bonds . treasuries are still the most liquid curve , and that used by banks for benchmarking risky debt . there is a considerable a liquidity / scarcity premium inherent within the corporate - treasury spread , which we are not taking into account . more accurate measurement of this premium should allow us to calculate bankruptcy prices based on treasuries , which are consistent with the market . all further comments are welcome of course . regards ben",ham

"Subject: pserc denver meeting vince , the pserc meeting lance and i went to was both interesting and boring . pserc has 11 school members and 30 industry members . its research program consists of three stems : markets , transmission and distribution , and systems . ( enron ' s interests probably lie mainly in the first stem . ) in morning of the first day , researchers from universities presented their project proposals . i found some of them quite interesting . for example , shmuel oren , fernando alvarado , tim mount ( of cornell ) propose to study "" market redesign : incorporating the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market design , "" shijie deng , s . oren et al propose to study "" power asset valuation model in a market - based and reliability - constrained electric power system . "" the first got funded but the second did not . in the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their own discussion . i went to the academic discussion and lance the industry one . i hope my presence there did not make things worse , for the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion . the proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants . the proposal process goes as follows : researchers first write a short proposal to appropriate stem committee ( no industry participantion , it seems to me ) , each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4 . the selected proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry . industry then gets to vote which proposals get funded . however , some researchers were very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process . there were accusation of self - ranking , communication between stem committee and member schools breaking down , and so on . some were even asking for some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before wrting it ( the arguement was "" then it was a waste of our time to write proposals "" , which i found quite amusing ) . all in all , i found the process was not taken seriously enough by university researchers . pserc has been established for 5 years now and it still does not have a proper proposal screen process , which is hard to believe . also , the communication among university researchers , between stem committee and member schools , and most importantly , between researchers and industry , are not smooth as all . since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members , the "" right "" projects may not get funded . too many participants also make the decision process very indecisive and quite painful to watch ( lance can comment on this better ) . they also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which made the voting a less authoritive . i believe enron will not get much returns from join pserc ( price tag is $ 40 , 000 per company per year ) . if we find some projects interesting , we can sponsor the schools in the form of summer interns , the schools claim that most of the fund goes to support students anyway . alex",ham

"Subject: alex tartakovski as you may know , we are trying to schedule an interview for alex tartakovski in houston this week . i am copying everyone involved because i wont be able to coordinate this tomorrow . we just brought our new daughter home today and my wife is yelling at me to get out of my office . i just found out that thursday & friday are bad days for him , so wednesday is the only day to do it this week . he would come down tuesday night and fly out wednesday evening . it ' s probably easiest for him to arrange his flight , but he will need a hotel and transportation from the airport . i gave him donna ' s phone number for help . i assume the hyatt would be best . his home number is 215 - 702 - 3705 and during the day his cellular is 267 - 981 - 5425 . by way of background , i plan to bring in 3 people from outside the company to fill in some of the "" vacants "" in my group ' s org chart . the 3 areas of specialization that are needed to execute the business plan are ( 1 ) coordination of origination , ( 2 ) deal pricing and underwriting , and ( 3 ) modeling and portfolio management . alex is the perfect person for # 3 . he has the deepest knowledge of probability of anyone i know and is efficient at building analysis models , which will be a big job in this business because portfolio management needs to be redefined in real time due to the lumpiness of insurance contracts and the lack of any historical methods for evaluating these risks . development of pricing models will be a joint effort between "" my "" group and the research dept because this will need to draw on the expertise in research as well as being a realtime activity as new deals are being structured . i want to encourage joint work between vasant / amitava and alex because his background and expertise is compatible with research . over the past 2 years , alex and i spent a lot of time developing new electricity spot pricing methodology and this is one area where he excels . i would expect that he would be a valuable resource in research as well , and so i would like for him to be able to meet with vince is possible . ( this could possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time - ( ? ) ) depending on what work needs to be done in the future , i could see him working both on pricing research and this specific business unit . i have attached alex ' s resume . i assume he would be manager level , but i ' m not sure of this . this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume , but the skills that are useful to us are : probability / statistical model development development of theoretical pricing methodology excellent computer programming skills database development and data analysis he has the best understanding of the nerc reliability data format outside of mike curley , the nerc data manager . designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by ace power products for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt . excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to hedging insurance portfolios . if you want to get into superconductor trading , he can design the standards . can beat me at atari battlezone ( as well as being able to navigate a real tank through a minefield ) . one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with the organization ( with which you did such a good job for me ) and to give him confidence that he will be able to do state - of - the - art pricing research in the most innovative company in the world . he is also interviewing for a job in morgan stanley ' s equity dept . we will also arrange a meeting with per in ny , but i would like to be in the office for that , so we can do that next week . please call me @ 610 - 996 - 2522 if there are any questions . i may not pick up but i will reply to voicemail promptly . i ' m up 24 hours this week anyway . thanks , - - dave",ham

( as of june 19 ) 2 ) looking at copper position you calculate a var of - 3 , 100 , 568 with a total outright of 63 . 765 mt . this seams too low . if i calculate 63765 x 1807 x 3 . 99 % = 4 . 218 mil . us $ . var ( outright qty x price levelx risk factor , riskfactr as per mercur ) . in my view we have been understating var in mercur because we do not consider the spread position correctly ( i . e . in detail ) . on a position like that i would expect a figure of around 6 mil us $ . i guess the issue is in the volatility and in the holding period . 3 ) your correlation matrix for the commodities is not final i assume as many fields are blank . lets talk tomorrow on the phone . attached please find the position summary for the last week # 30 ( since june 19 ) as requested by kirstee .

( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines . to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle . genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way . a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe . japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly . japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 . genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test . management : dr . tony milici -

i have had people compliment my fingernails . they have been growing like crazy ! c . c . , oh this is a unique , one of a kind product . i have been using it 3 weeks and i can truly see a difference in the liver spots on my hands . the prescription from my dermatologist didn ' t do it , but this product did . m . f . , ms i have been watching myself very closely , and since using the product , the brown spots on my hand have just about disappeared . the smile lines and the eyelids have really tightened up . no more problems putting my eyeliner on ! the skin under my chin has really tightened up . this is not hard work , it is just sharing the product with family and friends . i have never been rewarded so quickly and so well . e . p . , ca k . d . , tx i was queen of skeptical . i did not want to try this . i am a 54 yr old grandmother . i have tried everything for years to get rid of cellulite - the creams , the wraps - nothing worked . my husband kept telling me to try this . finally i did it just to get him off my back . i had not worn shorts for 5 years . after about 10 days , my husband started telling me my legs were looking better . i thought he was just being nice since he got me into this . then i went shopping , and in the lights in the dressing room , for the first time in a long time i looked pretty good . i went into the next dressing room , because i thought the lights were wrong , but i still looked good . i ended up buying shorts , and have been wearing shorts for the lst time in 5 years . yes , it works ! ! g . c . , tx we just had a booth at the women s expo in dallas . out of the 300 or 400 exhibitors there , the only other spot that had the people we did were the ones giving out free food . v . c . , tx i did the 1 side of the face test , and i did not tell my spouse that i was doing it . we went to get some fast food . he was looking at me , and said i can tell you which side you are using it on . it s your right side . i asked what made him think so , and he said the lines around my mouth and eyes have softened , and the fine lines around my neck . we are tickled , because everyone we talk to wants it ! j . d . , tx after using your product for less than a week , i ran into a friend who asked me what i was doing to look so young ! i have a full - time job , but i have made $ 8 , 000 since starting this business part time !

"Subject: re : pre - submitted question on espeak erin , a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent non - technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most important references to more advanced books and papers . the book has an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page . the research group offered several one - day seminars on real options and applications to the energy industry . we still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested . we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall . the first part of the seminar ( about 4 hours in the morning ) covers general concept of real options and their applicability to the energy business . the second , more technical afternoon session , covers stochastic processes used to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case studies ( valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas - fired power plants ) . the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty . nobody in this field claims that this is a perfect tool , but it represents a significant progress compared to other techniques developed earlier . discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several , in most cases , arbitrary scenarios ( most likely , optimistic , pessimistic ) . these scenarios don ' t identify explicitly the risk drivers and don ' t specify the future proactive management decisions . the real , option approach is very powerful because it allows to ( 1 ) capture uncertainty in an explicit way and ( 2 ) to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to downside risk . this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and future operational decisions . forward - looking investment decisions create options that are exercised in the future through active management of a project . the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to come up with the representation of future possible states of the world . the real challenge is to use these tools in a sensible way . i have seen in my career ( almost 30 years of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems ) many quants armed with powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers . the challenge is not to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand specific businesses into parsimonious quantitative models . it is especially critical to stress - test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends critically on any set of assumptions . if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying assumptions . i remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the dynamics of oil prices , but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very optimistic upward trend . one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question what economics 101 teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand . enron north america corp . from : erin rice @ enron 06 / 27 / 2000 03 : 52 pm to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : pre - submitted question on espeak good news ! there is already a question waiting for your july 12 espeak session . i have pasted it below , although you don ' t have to respond until the actual event . don ' t forget to send a bulleted list of discussion topics if you would still like us to advertise the event on the elevator screens . thanks . - er submitted by breineck i was doing some reading about the application of real options in the evaluation of non - financial assets . would you recommend any texts or articles for a more in - depth study of this area ? is quantification of risk or uncertainty the major challenge in using this concept ? can statistical tools be used with this to do a sort of sensitivity analysis ?",ham

"Subject: eol wti historical trade simulation - more profitable trading strategy please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue , which contains some typos . greg and john , i found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of trades ( keeping the total volume per day constant ) , we can be more profitable . this is partially because in a trending market we lose less money by following the market more closely . for example , suppose market move from $ 30 to $ 35 . if per trade volume is 10 , 000 bbl and the half bid - offer spread is $ 1 for simplicity , we take 5 trades of short positions , the total mtm for that day is ( - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) * 10 , 000 = - $ 150 , 000 and total trading volume is 50 , 000 bbl short . if per trade volume is 50 , 000 bbl , we take one trade , the total mtm is - 5 * 50 , 000 = - $ 250 , 000 . thus the net difference between the two trading strategies is $ 10 , 000 for that particular day . therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the number of trades , we can be more profitable as a market maker . i rerun a scenario that stinson sent to you on dec . 27 where he used per trade volume of 30 , 000 bbl . i reduce the number of trade to 10 , 000 while increasing the number of trades by factor of 3 . almost in all cases , i saw increased profitability . see the colume marked "" change "" for dollar amount change in millions . please let stinson or me know your thoughts on this . regards , zimin lu x 36388 as compared to",ham

steve : i ' ll see if i can get in on the 25 th . . . will let you know , but i think it ' ll work . just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be interested , abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying behavior in the world ( 89 million us households , 3 billion + purchases ) , along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer response to various offers at the household level . given the critical need to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets , we believe that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to whatever the offer is - - improving the efficiency of mailings and other promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! ) because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and "" new entrants "" i ' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have some tests of our data underway , but we ' re interested in talking to as many players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet utility needs . i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron might have interest in hearing what we ' re up to , and ( most importantly ) listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets . thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and hearing how things are going for you . regards , brad davids 303 - 410 - 5531 - - - - - original message - - - - - from : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com [ mailto : steven . r . meyers @ enron . com ] sent : monday , april 10 , 2000 12 : 13 pm to : brad . davids @ abacus - direct . com subject : re : possible meeting ?

"Subject: re : progress steve , thanks a lot . i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem ( for example , complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality ) into the code . regarding tanya ' s attitude . just a few points . 1 . i don ' t think she has the skills to do the system administrator ' s work and she does not have the necessary privileges . this explains why she keeps asking winston for help . it ' s not that the work is beneath her . 2 . some members of tanya ' s team came to me complaining about winston . he effectively told them to go away and work on the "" research projects "" and that he would take care of the it issues . i don ' t think that it ' s just tanya ' s issue , though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful . 3 . the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and / or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run . they could not care less about the demarcation line between it and research . they also want tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code . the bottom line is that we are in full agreement : tanya and winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that it happens . credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail . vince from : stephen stock / enron @ enronxgate on 01 / 11 / 2001 08 : 23 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : progress vince , i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking about some specific solutions to performance of it systems . . . in particular distributed processing . also i heard that you had concerns about the use of multiple languages etc . . . . both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous occasions . . . do you feel the need to discuss these further ? the multi - language issue isn ' t really that much of an issue , as the current system is 98 % java right now . although i am a big fan of c / c + + ( it is my main development skill ) , i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved and robust language . i had serious doubts about the performance , but i ' ve had a review conducted , and the results are showing the sun unix implementation to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than c / c + + because of something they call hot - spot technology . ( its an instruction caching technique , i believe ) . the concerns i expressed to you , were really about how technical people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively meaningless metric like portability . on the issue of distributed processing . . . the original review i had conducted by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution , and as zhiyong wei is already working on global valuation project , winston is actively working with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that , and also to find a common valuation piece between the systems . i ' d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some time over the next few days ? also , i sat in on the tanya / winston meeting yesterday and as per our discussion at the elevator , i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code . . . i . e . seperating research domain problems from it problems . she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were . i asked her how she would measure that , and she said she would instrument the code manually by inserting timing elements at strategic points . i mentioned that a profiling tool could probably do this job for her . tanya again said that stepping through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code , and that studying documentation wasn ' t enough . about 6 weeks ago , i commissioned a team to document the system down to psuedo - code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon . ( in fact i ' ve asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now ) , and winston is also working on a draft research / it "" working together "" document , which will identify how the exchange of information takes place . tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do all the environment setup for her , because she doesn ' t really want to have to do that . i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue . the it guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good , as it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her . she is claiming that they are un - cooperative . . . . they are claiming that she continually asks the same questions about set - up over and over again , and doesn ' t seem to want to learn how to do it . winston on the other hand , could be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and an it issue and ask for help from research . i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely . i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together over the next few days . . . . and debbie brackett and i will review their progress on friday . in the meantime l ' ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that doesn ' t involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer term solution . regards steve",ham

"Subject: take control of your difficulties mortgage consumer information newsletter our new mortgage structure makes your dreams come true . - get the best mortgage rates - choose the right loan program - understand second mortgages please visit our site for more information : http : / / catcall . lending - bloxs . com / index . php ? refid = fngl 2 several factors affect your mortgage rate : the amount of your loan can increase your interest rate if the amount financed exceeds the conforming loan limits established . the conforming loan limit changes at the beginning of each year . shorter loans , such as 20 year or 15 year note , can save you thousand of dollars in interest payments over the life of the loan , but your monthly payments will be higher . an adjustable rate mortgage may get you started with a lower interest rate than a fixed rate mortgage , but your payments could get higher when the interest rate changes . a larger down payment greater than 20 % - will give you the best possible rate . down payments of 5 % or less should expect to pay a higher rate as you are starting with less equity as collateral . if you ' ve got the cash now and want to lower your payments , you can pay on your loan to lower your mortgage rate . it ' s a simple concept , really : in exchange for more money upfront , lenders are willing to lower the interest rate they charge , cutting the borrower ' s payments . closing costs are fees paid by the lender , if you don t want to pay all of the closing costs , expect a higher rate which will pay the lender additional interest over the life of the loan . credit quality and debt - to - income - ratio affect the terms of your loan through fico score . if you have good credit and your monthly income far surpasses your monthly debt obligations , you will get approved at a lower interest rate . however , if your monthly income barely covers your minimum debt obligations , even if you have a credit report , you will not receive the lowest available interest rate . our site has more info : http : / / brigantine . lending - bloxs . com / index . php ? refid = fngl 2 get your hands on some cash : another way to make a refinance work for you is to refinance for more than the balance remaining on your old mortgage - - in effect , tapping your home equity , or "" cashing out , "" in mortgage speak . thanks to favorable rates , you may be able to do so without boosting your monthly outlay . for example , at 8 . 5 % , the payment on a $ 200 , 000 , 30 - year fixed rate mortgage is $ 1 , 538 . but at 7 . 5 % , that same payment lets you borrow nearly $ 20 , 000 more . the best use for the extra cash is to pay off any higher rate loans you may have . let ' s say that you are carrying a $ 15 , 000 car loan at 10 % and making minimum payments on a $ 10 , 000 credit card balance at 17 % . your monthly payments on those debts would total $ 680 . then assume you refinanced your mortgage , taking out an additional $ 25 , 000 to pay off your car and credit card loans . result : at 7 . 5 % , your additional monthly mortgage payment would total only $ 175 , so you would come out $ 505 ahead ( $ 680 - $ 175 = $ 505 ) . of course , all the extra cash needn ' t go for paying off debts . when the menards swapped their arm for a fixed rate last december , they also increased their mortgage load by $ 34 , 000 , from $ 106 , 000 to $ 140 , 000 . they used $ 3 , 000 of the proceeds to pay their refinancing costs and another $ 17 , 000 to pay off a 10 % home equity loan , which had been costing them $ 250 a month . then they spent the remaining $ 14 , 000 to build a garage for roger ' s antique car collection - - and they did all this for just another $ 19 a month if you wish to stop future mailings , please mail to http : / / sperry . lending - bloxs . com / r . php thank you",spam

"Subject: re : houston research opportunity : anjam vince : here is an explanation of what a 12 month package for anjam actually entails . it seems to me that anjam ' s interest in getting an expat package is mostly about money . based on the uk hr ' s read of anjam , they think he will jump . i have a telephone conference with anjam at 11 : 00 . my stance will be 110 is firm . we will help with the transition via a one time settlement : flat rental issues , 500 lbs of air shipping for moving furniture , maybe one trip back to uk a year , but no more . re : his concerns of having a place in london should he want to return , i will say that vince would be far better at finding a good spot for you than any hr type , so that part of the "" package "" promise is not particularly important . any guidelines for me to follow , coach ? regards , grant . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by grant masson / hou / ect on 08 / 11 / 2000 08 : 44 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tara rozen 08 / 11 / 2000 05 : 44 am to : grant masson / hou / ect @ ect cc : melanie doyle / lon / ect @ ect , jane allen / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : houston research opportunity grant not sure if i told you that i work mon , wed , friday hence the delay in responding . sorry if i forgot to tell you ! another contact name in my absence who will be able to assist is jane allen in houston ( cc ' ed above ) . three main reasons we try to stay away from assignments to the us for this type / level of transfer are : 1 ) cost 2 ) equitability among other peers 3 ) difficulty in transferring employee to local package from assignment package . however , if this is truly a 12 month assignment with no intention of extension , we would normally do the following : 12 month assignment london base , car allowance , and benefits and national insurance contribution costs ( currently 12 . 2 % of all comp compared with 1 . 45 % of all comp plus 6 . 2 % up to max of $ 76 k of employers us contribution ) housing costs in houston paid if maintaining housing in the uk ( usually up to $ 1800 per month for single ) utility costs if maintaining a house in the uk - up to $ 100 per month home leave - two economy trips per year is standard transportation to / from assignment - economy class transportation in houston - we normally give this - up to $ 40 per day for rental car in addition to the person ' s car allowance as they normally do not require a car in the uk and take the car allowance as a cash benefit whereas they will require a car in houston . shipment of goods - 500 lbs air tax assistance disturbance allowance - normally pay approx $ 1000 so , in terms of costs if you just compare a local us salary of manager on $ 100 k to a local uk manager on o 68 k the us total cost is approx $ 120 k . the uk cost is approx $ 230 k . then if you add the above costs to the assignment , you will see an even greater increase in cost compared with the local peers , ie approx $ 280 k compared with $ 120 k . we do have the ability to change the above in any way as there is no set policy ; however , anjam has already brought up other people ' s assignments and i have a feeling he will do his best to find out what everyone else is receiving . if we make clear , though , that we are keeping on uk payroll but not providing any assignment type allowances just in order for him to maintain his pension contributions for the year and at which point a decision will need to be made ( returns or moves to local us ) , then we may be able keep more consistency with your group while maintaining more reasonable costs . not sure how you want to play this , though . even if he does go on assignment rather than transfer locally , there is still the issue of whether or not a suitable job will be here at the end of the 12 months . we will always do our best to find suitable postions but we cannot guarantee it . if he transfers to a local us contract , enron europe ' s responsibility of finding suitable employment is pretty much nil . i hope this has made things clearer rather than more complicated . i honestly feel that ajnam will absolutely not take this position if it is not on an assignment basis . he made it pretty clear that unless he could stay on uk payroll for 12 months , he would not transfer . call me if you would like to discuss . tara - x 36763 enron capital & trade resources corp . from : grant masson 09 / 08 / 2000 20 : 48 to : tara rozen / lon / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : houston research opportunity tara : thanks for the update . it seems anjam is playing hard ball a little . my initial reaction is to be inflexible because it is a good offer , but on second thoughts , could you please give me an idea of what is meant by a 12 - month assignment when you have a moment ? compensation , benefits , responsibilities , career path implications , etc . many thanks ! regards , grant .",ham

placed sources in the government , the company has informed the madhav godbole panel that it would be meeting on may 11 . earlier reports had indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on may 5 . according to sources , enron would be meeting the panel with representatives of its lenders and shareholders . the godbole committee , that studied the current power purchase agreement , has called for cancellation of the present tariff structure , renegotiation of the lng and shipping contract , removal of dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned , debt restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement . these suggestions , it seems , may not be acceptable to enron . the maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the godbole committee to renegotiate . the committee has been given a month  , s time to renegotiate on behalf of the state government with dpc for a new ppa . the committee has opined that since the lng facility of 5 mmpta is far in excess of what is required by the plant ( only 2 . 1 mmpta of which 1 . 8 mmpta is on take or pay ) , it should be separated into a distinct facility whose capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge , not as take or pay . it should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the power generation . using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high plf . instead , the surplus gas can be sold to other players like petronet or enron  , s own metgas .  & it is important to distribute the cost over the entire capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant ,  8 says the committee . similarly , it has been suggested that enron could lease out the harbour facilities as a common facility to other lng importers . on the lng contract negotiated by enron for long - term supplies , it has said that since the lng market has witnessed great changes , particularly as far as prices are concerned , the power company should take advantage of spot buys and renegotiate the contract accordingly . -

led re - negotiation committee set - up to facilitate the restructuring of the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) signed between the us power major and the state government . officials of dabhol power company ( dpc ) , a subsidiary of enron , alongwith their team of shareholders and lenders will arrive here on may 11 for talks with the nine - member godbole panel . though the dpc spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation , a key mantralaya official told the times of india that the team had expressed willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the imbroglio . enron ' s response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks , with the board of directors of enron authorising its india md k wade cline to serve a termination notice to mseb . the state government , on its part , too adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for defaulting on power supply . however , the sudden change of heart by the enron management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders led by industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) which had recently opposed the move to pull out of the project . this was in contradiction to the stand taken by the foreign lenders of the dpc who were in favour of slamming the brakes on disbursement of funds to dpc . the congress - led democratic front government had publicly declared that it would impress upon the enron management to renegotiate the ppa as scrapping the project would not be in the interest of both the parties . last week , the state government constituted a nine - member panel of experts under former bureaucrat madhav godbole . godbole had written to the dpc management inviting it for talks to re - negotiate the ppa on may 5 . for the delayed response from enron , the meeting has been rescheduled to may 11 . the issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the lng facility from the power plant , renegotiating lng supply and shipping agreements , redefining the dpc tariff and to convert it into a two - part tariff . the godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the maharashtra government to sell power to third parties . - - - - - - -

arrival of its team from houston and other parts of the world . however , the company has ultimately decided to meet the godbole committee on may 11 . dpc spokesman jimmy mogal said :  & we confirm that dpc has been invited to meet the recently formed negotiating committee . as a matter of courtesy , we have agreed to meet them next week . since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts , we will not present any proposals .  8  & while we have constantly maintained that we are open to a dialogue towards resolving issues , this meeting in no manner be construed as an open offer from dpc to renegotiate the terms of the contract . furthermore , the published terms report do not represent an acceptable basis for further discussions ,  8 he added . sources said enron corp chairman kenneth lay is likely to meet former chief minister sharad pawar to find an acceptable solution for the ongoing crisis before the may 11 meet . mr lay told the foreign news agency on wednesday that the enron corp has no immediate plans to sell its stake in the troubled $ 2 . 9 -

"Subject: re : option pricing challenge zimin , to generalize your initial comment , for any process ds = mu ( s , t ) * s * dt + sigma ( s , t ) * s * dz , the delta - hedging argument leads to the black - scholes pde . this is true for any arbitrary functions mu and sigma , and so includes gbm , mean reversion , and others . there is no problem with this , because in the risk - neutral world , which is what you enter if you can hedge , the drift of the "" actual "" process is irrelevant . i believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price for mean reversion process . this can only happen if the asset is not hedgeable , and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the option pricing . if you assume that the underlying is a non - traded factor , then the pde will have to reflect the market price of risk , and the drift of the actual process is then reflected in the pde . vasant zimin lu 10 / 17 / 2000 05 : 20 pm to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , pinnamaneni krishnarao / hou / ect @ ect , alex huang / corp / enron @ enron , kevin kindall / corp / enron @ enron , tanya tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : option pricing challenge dear all , i have a fundamental question back in my mind since 95 . hope you can give me a convincing answer . zimin - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - in deriving bs differential equation , we assume the underlying follows gbm ds = mu * s * dt + sigma * s * dz where mu is the drift , sigma is the volatility , both can be a function of s . then we use delta hedging argument , we obtain the bs differential equation for the option price , regardless of mu . with the bs pde and boundary condition , we can derive bs formula . fine . no problem . question comes here . suppose the underlying is traded security and follows , say , mean - reverting process ds = beta ( alpha - s ) dt + sigma * s * dz apparantly , this sde leads to a different probability distribution . however , using the delta hedging argument , we still get the same bs differential equation , with the same boumdary condition , we get the same bs formula . not fair ! from another angle , i can derive the distribution from the bs pde for the underlying , which is the lognormal distribution . my thinking is : can i drive the distribution for any sde from the option pde ? the answer should be yes , but got to be from a different pde rather than bs pde . then what we do about the delta - hedging argument ? thanks .",ham

"Subject: otc gdvi - the momentum continues - gdvi website debute otc bbalert gdvi news update : global diversified industries debutes brand new website ! www . gdvi . net otc bb alert spectacular operating results momentum continues sales projections for next 12 months surpasses $ 20 million 99 . 8 % revenue increase 278 % net income increase 154 % stockholders equity increase 79 % increase in assets $ 8 million order backlog $ 50 million manufacturing capacity overview global diversified industries operates in the modular building construction industry , and strategically targets the california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in central california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot state - of - the - art manufacturing facility . throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth . through the combination of its new facility ( $ 50 million capacity ) , the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california ' s bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast . gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies . global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 , including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in 2005 . the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per annum businesses . in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition candidates through its aggressive growth plan . profile gdvi is a holding company that currently operates two wholly owned subsidiaries , mbs construction inc . , a modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and global modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures . its principal customer base is currently educational ( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care and municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs , including both single - story and two - story floor plans . global modular ' s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre - approved building plans , commonly referred to as p . c . ' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) . global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause . the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district . this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids . a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years , depending on the term of the piggyback contract . the strategic focus on california schools since 1998 , california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures . there are five compelling reasons for this trend : modular classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks ) they cost significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 ) they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth , the state department of education estimates that california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms . due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector , public and private schools are expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years . the california schools budget crisis on november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by california voters . this bond measure passage does not include an approximate $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state . a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the voters on the march 2004 . these bond measures are about three times higher than the record $ 9 . 2 billion bond california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations . money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other institutions of higher learning throughout california . gdvi business infrastructure among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated , state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular structures . gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking to add to its workforce as demand increases . operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square foot operating structure . wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets , designs and manufactures the buildings wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles installation and building renovation . symbol otc . bb gdvi recent price 13 . 5 cents management team philip hamilton , ceo and president mr . hamilton has an extensive and very successful background in modular manufacturing . from 1996 to feb 2000 he served as chairman and ceo of pacesetter industries inc . he built this company from inception into one of californias largest manufacturers , producing and installing thousands of schools and commercial buildings . under his leadership , pacesetter industries moved into a 5 , 500 , 000 sq . ft . facility in atwater , california with branch sales offices throughout the state . the company employed a staff of over 650 employees and had annual sales of $ 50 , 000 , 000 . adam de bard , vice president mr . de bard has over 6 years of experience in the manufacturing and business sectors . from 1997 to 2000 he served as vice president and chief information officer of pacesetter industries . ronald kilpatrick , director of finance mr . kilpatrick has 36 years experience in both domestic and international development and management of major corporations . he is a managing partner of pacific rim capital llc which provides venture capital to projects in the pacific rim . recent headlines global diversified industries , inc . commencing efforts to increase its u . s . based investor and public relations visibility pr newswire ( tue 5 : 00 am ) global diversified industries , inc . modular division secures new order worth more than $ 3 million for immediate delivery pr newswire ( thu , jun 9 ) wallst . net airing all - new , exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and geoi pr newswire ( tue , jun 7 ) wallst . net airing exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and xle pr newswire ( thu , jun 2 ) global diversified industries , inc . acquires valuable assets from california modular company pr newswire ( thu , may 26 ) global diversified industries , inc . modular division implementing its fourth production line pr newswire ( thu , may 19 ) talkingstocks . com announces interview with philip hamilton , president and ceo of global diversified industries , inc . primezone media network ( tue , may 17 ) stockguru . com initiates profile coverage of global diversified industries , inc . primezone media network ( mon , may 16 ) global diversified industries ' modular division billings total $ 1 . 4 million in april ;

"Subject: p + option valuation model mark , after recently reviewing the booking of the p + options , it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes ( i . e . the price process assumptions are consistent with standard black - 76 model assumptions extended to two commodities ) . the payoff for a call option is : payoff = max ( 0 , a - b - k ) . where : a = nxwti ( delivery price for nymex ) b = posting price = ( wti swap ) - ( posting basis ) k = posting bonus ( fixed ) . the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options is that leg "" b "" of the spread is a combination of three prices , the two futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month , and the average posting basis during the delivery month . combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg "" b "" and the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of prices and its correlation with the nxwti price . i believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative , which would be to use a three or four - commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices . in summary , i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options , assuming that the inputs are set correctly . regards , stinson gibner v . p . research",ham

"Subject: adaptive trade vince , zimin , i participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning . there was a possibility enron would invest in it . their product appears to be a gui interface over the top of ilog solver ( and possibly ilog cplex ) which allows problems to be expressed in high level terms . i do not see any immediate application at enron , but i am interested in the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo . maybe it would be useful for general modelling projects here . they do not even have a user manual for their software , so it will be difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged . the possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ilog software is a modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that market . i think the scheduling tools in sap , i 2 , etc are more likely to succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information system . because of the small market for this software , the many competitors , the absence of any clear use for it at enron and the early stage of development , there is very little prospect of us funding this company . tom",ham

"Subject: re : var vince thanks for the update - especially your point 3 which echoes our own discussion yesterday : i want to clarify responsibilities for maintenance and administration of var . we need transparency around the process so that mapping decisions , for example , are easily made , supported and reviewed . it became clear after last friday ' s events , that we are in an awkward paradigm with respect to how we handle var here , particularly at "" pressure points "" . i am putting together the scope of a "" general overhaul "" of the var process , including method and administration , to which i hope we would all buy in , so be assured of our co - operation . dp - - - - - original message - - - - - from : kaminski , vince sent : wednesday , april 11 , 2001 2 : 49 pm to : port , david cc : lavorato , john ; kaminski , vince ; tamarchenko , tanya subject : var david , during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations . mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system : we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves . we have agreed on the following : 1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run . 2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates . 3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions . this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ; cooperation of trading and rac will be critical . vince",ham
"Subject: capital book to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge . the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below . the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged . capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity . on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost . by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization . questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to : joe deffner 853 - 7117 alan quaintance 345 - 7731",ham

"Subject: hedge effectiveness test for fair value hedges gentlemen : we have had favorable responses regarding the use of our volatility reduction method ( roger , i ' ve attached a copy of our article in case you hadn ' t seen it ) . however , there continued to be a quibble about how to create the set of data points that would be inputs into the testing process . last week the consulting arm of a "" big five "" accounting firm indicated that the following method proposed by us would be acceptable . we believe this method overcomes the statistical problems that arise from using interest rate differences from overlapping ( "" rolling "" ) quarters . method : 1 ) calculate daily yield curve changes expressed as ratios , using historical rates from the most recent , say , two years . ( note : no overlap ) . this results in a set of around 494 vectors of ratios ( approximately 247 trading days per year ) . example : if the first three yield curves in the historical set look like this : 19980801 6 . 5 6 . 6 6 . 7 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 2 19980802 6 . 3 6 . 3 6 . 6 . . . . . . . . . 6 . 9 19980803 6 . 6 6 . 8 6 . 9 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 1 then the change from 8 / 1 / 98 to 8 / 2 / 98 is : 6 . 3 / 6 . 5 6 . 3 / 6 . 6 6 . 6 / 6 . 7 . . . . . . . . . . 6 . 9 / 7 . 1 and the change from 8 / 2 / 98 to 8 / 3 / 98 is : 6 . 6 / 6 . 3 6 . 8 / 6 . 3 6 . 9 / 6 . 6 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 1 / 6 . 9 2 ) randomly select 62 of these "" ratio "" vectors ( approx . 62 trading days in a quarter ) . 3 ) multiply these ratio vectors together to get a single vector ( ie , the 62 6 mo ratios are multiplied together , the 62 lyr ratios are multiplied togeter , etc . ) . the result represents a single quarterly yield curve transformation . apply it to "" today ' s "" yield curve . the resulting yield curve represents one simulated quarterly change in interest rates 4 ) repeat steps 2 and 3 until an adequate number of yield curves are generated , say 100 . 5 ) proceed with testing process . i would be interested in your comments . leslie abreo andrew kalotay associates , inc . 61 broadway , ste 3025 new york ny 10006 phone : ( 212 ) 482 0900 fax : ( 212 ) 482 0529 email : leslie . abreo @ kalotay . com visit aka ' s website at http : / / www . kalotay . com - fasl 33 article . pdf",ham

"Subject: interesting article about enron in japan ' s electricity newspaper japan ' s electricity newspaper ( "" denki shimbun "" , the equivalent of megawatt daily ) has been running a series of articles about the new century . several of these have focused on the power industry in the u . s . a friend of mine ran across one on enron that was published on april 13 and sent it to me . i thought you would find it interesting . the article focuses on ees in particular and about how we try to succeed by being first to meet our clients ' changing needs . it also describes how we use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive . the article also briefly mentions the new office in japan . the most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is about enron . given what i have read and heard about how nervous the japanese are about deregulation of the industry , i really did not expect such praise . denki shimbun also has a web site at "" www . shimbun . denki . or . jp "" . they have small summaries of the important articles of the day ( the site , however , is completely in japanese ) . another interesting site is "" www . criepi . denken . or . jp "" , the english home site of japan ' s central research institute of electric power industry ( denryoku chuo kenkyuujou ) . the site has many links to other english - language sites related to the power industry in japan . regards , eugenio",ham

"Subject: interview - credit derivatives dear vince : thank you for the invitation yesterday . it was a pleasure to meet you all and learn more about the group , it ' s structure and to some extent what you are involved in . please extend my thanks to all of them . i am particularly interested in the credit swap trading platform that enron has recently started . such a platform will provide unique visibility into the credit markets . as you suggested i tried to learn more about this from tanya . i would like to learn more and if possible meet other people more directly linked to the effort . just simple instruments like credit swaps will require serious modelling capability for the pricing and the hedging of these apparently simple intruments . the market visibility i mention above can be explored through credit derivatives trading successfully if enron possesses superior ( vis a vis morgan stanley , salomon smith barney , chase manhatan , etc . ) modelling technology in credit derivatives . i can and would like to consider the possibility of doing this for enron . i would like to help develop and participate in putting together that business . as i mentioned to you i have done some work in credit derivatives and am deeply familiar with virtually all the work of the principal academics in credit derivatives namely : duffie , lando , tuffano , duffee , das , lelland , etc . i have read carefully most of their work ( published as well as working papers ) on the subject to date . i look forward to hearing from you . best regards joao",ham

"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . "" at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist , who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected at this time . although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations , needing no further training and only minimal supervision . once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous . stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion and major upgrade of this web page . these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail , to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations assistance . in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",ham

"Subject: meeting with mr . sud rebecca , as we had spoken on the phone , i met with mr . kk sud , a retired secretary in the govt . of india yesterday . this meeting was arranged at vince ' s request , since vince had been approached by mr . sud ' s son who is a student at rice ( where vince teaches a course ) . the younger mr . sud had wanted someone at enron to meet with his father who was visiting houston , and is currently an advisor ( post retirement from the government ) to the prime minister ' s office . this was my first meeting , and i have no background check on the person . however , the meeting was interesting , and mr . sud conveyed to me in confidence that the indian govt . is very interested in solving the dabhol issue . he also conveyed that a decision is being made in the direction of ntpc buying all the power from dabhol , but that this was still under wraps . i have no way of judging the genuineness of this person , but he claimed to have been secretary in the ministry of defence for some 16 years , which is a very important post in india . the information he was conveying seemed so important that vince and i decided to update you on the same by phone this morning . mr . sud is leaving houston on monday so , as discussed , i will see if he can meet with you on saturday morning . regards , sandeep .",ham

"Subject: a colossal and dangerous failure - cera alert title : a colossal and dangerous failure url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2185 overview : western energy  * california governor stays the course california governor gray davis provided his strongest public statements to date regarding the state  , s power crisis in his annual state of the state address on january 8 , 2001 . echoing many of his previous positions on what he perceives as a flawed and unfair california market structure , the governor labeled the state  , s electricity market system a colossal and dangerous failure . among other actions , he launched new initiatives valued at $ 1 billion to encourage conservation , provide financing and land to new generators , grant authority to utilities to engage in a portfolio of transactions to manage electricity costs , and increase regulatory scrutiny of existing market suppliers . the governor also called for a greater role for the state in overseeing and constructing new power plants . the governor acknowledged that the actions proposed are only some of the steps necessary to put california on the road to recovery . details regarding sources of funding for the initiative are still forthcoming . although he stated that california  , s investor - owned utilities must not be allowed to go bankrupt , no formal plan for ensuring their solvency was given . the financial community continues to lack the assurance it requires to continue to provide financial backing for pacific gas and electric and southern california edison . at this time the state legislature remains the body most likely to guarantee their solvency . the governor again criticized the federal energy regulatory commission for what he believes has been its failure to manage and restrain properly the wholesale market . merchant plant generators were accused of gouging the state , and it was suggested that these generators acted illegally in their operations , jeopardizing the reliability of the power grid . new , more severe sanctions were promised for those caught withholding power or extracting what investigators find as unreasonable profits . a los angeles times poll released the morning before the governor  , s address indicated that the majority of californians still do not believe there is an energy crisis . although the 33 percent growth in the state  , s economy over the past ten years has nearly outstripped the state  , s and surrounding region  , s supplies of power , the bulk of the governor  , s statements continue to focus on the culpability of power producers , rather than the serious supply shortfall . though the governor introduced steps to fund and facilitate the construction of new generating plants , increased regulatory scrutiny and the threat of sanctions will exacerbate the concern already expressed by plant developers and the financial community that the investment climate in california is excessively risky . * * end * * follow above url for complete report . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 ! for more information and to register , please visit http : / / www 20 . cera . com / ceraweek / e - mail category : alert cera knowledge area ( s ) : western energy , to make changes to your cera . com account go to : forgot your username and password ? go to : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / client / forgot this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"Subject: comments hi sheridan , how are you ? i hope that you had a good vacation . vasant and i looked at your memo and found it to be interesting . i shall first briefly summarize our understanding of the methodology you propose . the comments follow . finally , i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case in further refining the model . it appears that you are proposing a state - space approach where probabilities of different states at various future dates are specified . the next step is to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the branches from the origin to one of the terminal points . traversing through the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the average present value of the project . also , you are using the simulation to assign a value of the project to each node . thus each node will have a cash flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward . if some of these values turn out to be negative , zero - coupon , risk - free bonds are purchased to neutralize the negative realization . next , we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our project ( based on the variance of the returns ) . we iterate until convergence . finally , we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital from the pv of the gross cash flows ( including debt ) to determine if the project merits further consideration . comments / clarifications 1 . the money is being set aside to avoid negative values . it is not clear if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node . anyhow , we shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at that cross - section of time as the risk - free asset pays in all states of nature . this will have to be done every time there is a negative realization . thus , for the typical project we have , the value of risk capital may be extremely high , as we are not following a tail - based norm anymore . 2 . your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all values being positive . if so , we are only issuing risk - free debt . also , a project with a single negative value at each cross - section of time will not have a positive debt capacity . 3 . it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate , which is obtained in each step from the comparison investment ( by equating the variances ) . it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence . also , our project has a finite life and the market - based assets will have infinite lives . in the light of this fact , how will we define the relevant variance ? is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment ? 4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines the discount rate . gas field case to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below . we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of expected production and variance of the production per year is available from the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field to be 10 years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable operating costs . it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this problem . do let me know if you have further questions . rakesh",ham

"Subject: hurricane warning derivatives folks , this note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line of products . it is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane warning frequency and / or duration . it is our objective to develop derivative products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this exposure . we have generated a partial brainstorm - style list of whom natural counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure : pro - hurricane anti - hurricane the weather channel resorts home depot cruise ships lowes riverboat casinos cnn chemical plants and refineries local tv stations u . s armed forces dry ice manufacturers athletic teams chainsaw manufacturers city governments insect repellant manufacturers state governments it is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is important to note that the pro - hurricane entities are more macro in nature while the anti - hurricane entities are typically more regional . thus , we have documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the thought that the anti - hurricane entities would be interested in regional products and the pro - hurricane entities would likely be more interested in bundled regional products depending on their exposure . thus far , we have collected and documented all u . s hurricane warning data from 1980 - 2000 in the form of an excel database . the data can be sorted by year , storm , or location on the u . s coastline . total hurricane warning duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary data sets of interest for any given location ( or year or storm ) . the u . s coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly similar size . these regions are : new england , mid - atlantic , virginia , north carolina , georgia / south carolina , east florida , west florida , florida panhandle , orleans / miss / bama , lousiana , and texas . while this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes , it has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration is quite volatile and unpredictable . it is believed that this volaility , when graphically depicted and mathematically represented , could be used to effectively demonstrate to would - be customers the impact of hurricane warning frequency on their business financials . in many cases , businesses may be well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves . as we move forward on the modeling front , the data will certainly need to be scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends , satellite availability , population trends , etc . additionally , we need to go further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn ' t decline . on the marketing front , i am certainly open to ideas . it is believed the weather channel would be the most natural party for such a product . given our positive relationship that we currently have with them , they might be the easiest sell . any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when we should approach customers . please respond with any questions , comments or concerns on this project . thanks , charlie",ham

term contracts with power generators . under the bill , the state of california would control 10 % of all california ' s electricity . as you can imagine , this legislation has not received unanimous praise . according to recent corporate filings , pg & e ' s hydroelectric plants alone would be valued between $ 3 and $ 5 billion . this amount just happens to be what davis estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee once the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the $ 12 billion in debt . davis is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help with about $ 4 billion in debt , while the utilities , of course , say the full $ 12 billion should be covered . on wednesday , state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come . davis insists there are already several bids for his 5 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour ceiling , though few agree with his opinion . a handful of smaller , independent electricity providers with about a 30 % share of california power market , indicated sunday night they would come down to "" less than eight cents "" or less than half of what they currently charge , in return for the stability of long term contracts . because consumers pay about 6 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current puc rules , any hope california has to "" work off "" the back debts for these utilities lies in hitting something very close to davis ' price cap , without falling back on higher prices for consumers . the level of bids will be particularly important since bond rating agencies moved to put the state of california on a credit watch on friday , worried that there was no obvious long - term repayment plan for the billions of dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state . utility ' s audit by the middle of this week , california auditors will release their findings about how much money pg & e and socal edison actually owe to institutions outside their own holding company structure . this will define the limits of what the state will guarantee , if they guarantee any of the debt . the truly explosive part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years . a source with knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last three years , pg & e ' s utility subsidiary handed over about $ 5 billion to the holding company . of that total , the holding company used $ 4 . 4 billion to pay shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock . another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current power crisis when regulators , at the time of deregulation ( under the direction of former r - gov . pete wilson ) , forced the two utilities to sell at least half of their power - generating plants . auditors are expected to say that if the utilities still owned all these plants , electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt hour , compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in december and january . bankruptcy the threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities . senior advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility companies that ended in bankruptcy . as all the parties involved hunker down for another intensely political week , they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy , but to push this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an advantage . under such conditions , the risks of one or more of the players fumbling and triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy , is still quite high . california ' s political leaders order a series of independent analyses to determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy , the state or the two utilities . the short answer was that no one has any idea . below are the findings of the report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge : 1 ) would the companies be eligible for chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy ? some of the advisors thought that pg & e and edison ' s finances were so bad that chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option . advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the companies into full liquidation . this would most certainly be guaranteed chaos . 2 ) could the bankruptcy court actually force the puc to raise the price of electricity to consumers ? the legal basis for passing on rate increases to consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought , particularly if there is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies . and there is still the question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge . 3 ) if the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets seriously and finds that pg & e and edison cannot afford to buy electricity , he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages . 4 ) if the utilities go into bankruptcy , the first creditors in line would be the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges . the state could become almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier ( one of the reasons why suppliers won ' t sell electricity on credit to these companies now ) . 5 ) if the two companies went bankrupt , it would be the largest bankruptcies in history , straining just about everyone involved in the process . 6 ) the corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets from the utility by the ferc for pg & e and already in place for edison may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies currently think . this is particularly true if this week ' s audit shows the two corporations transferring billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder dividend payments . davis opinion polls show that governor gray davis is getting high marks for his job , and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits . one of davis concern ' s is , according to a senior official in the governor ' s office , that a deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so anti - utility and anti - business that it cripples future growth in the state . according to a senior official , "" no one thought howard jarvis and his property tax initiative would succeed in destroying our education system , but he did , with one just ballot line and a lot of popular revulsion . the threat of direct , popular action is at least as large now as then . "" consumer advocate harvey rosenfield is already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that individual electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay their debt through higher rate - payer bills . this official goes on to say , "" the anger at utility companies is so high here , that almost anything rosenfield could think of would pass and we couldn ' t do anything about it . "" this threat has begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always appeared wide open to political leaders - - floating a bond issue or a guarantee for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure , and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next several years .",ham

"Subject: california update 1 / 31 / 01 please do not hesitate to contact robert johnston ( x 39934 ) or kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) with additional questions . executive summary an announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of long - term contracts ( price and term ) . the threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as davis hatches a plan to 1 ) pass on "" court ordered rate increases "" and 2 ) issue revenue bonds . audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred to parent companies . davis is expected to use the threat of "" endless appeals "" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in november to keep the pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt , as well as to limit the scope of the rate hikes . davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to california consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy . davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups . if there is a ballot initiative in november to challenge the expected court - ordered rate hikes , it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state . legislation and bail out bill ablx was heard for several hours in the senate appropriations yesterday . issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure , specifically for communities that have harsh climates . however , the bill has received support from almost everyone including consumer groups . the bill is expected to pass sometime today . tim gage , ca director of finance said davis supports all the provisions in ablx and expected to sign . bill abl 8 x was not heard in the assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear today . in committee hearings monday , the dwr testified it is spent all of the $ 400 m and were spending $ 45 m / day in the spot market to buy power . according to sources with direct access to governor davis , the on - going court battle , as discussed below , is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a settlement . davis recognizes that 1 ) the expected court ruling in the cpuc case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to california rate payers ; 2 ) despite that ruling , the state government has the ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the two utilities unless they come to terms . thus , davis believes that california consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity charges , but he plans to use the threat of an appeal ( and a possible ballot initiative ) to limit the amount of the rate hikes . a plan to exempt the lowest income , smallest consumers from any rate increase and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130 % of a baseline usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in sacramento . that would still hit about one half of all consumers ( since the "" baseline "" is set at 60 % of average consumption ) , but it is "" progressive "" in a politically important sense . making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night when pg & e admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates . the company ' s defense ( they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash ) was met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious efforts by californians to use less electricity . "" every time you think there ' s a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves , something like this happens , "" one legislator moaned . long - term contracts a second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long - term power buying contracts davis initiated earlier this month . the first wave of those contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be surprisingly positive , according to officials in the talks . "" we got a series of good offers in those initial proposals . and some not so good ones , "" one official told our source . "" the idea is to announce the results of the first contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say , ' you want in on this with these terms ? ' we think we ' ll eventually shake loose a lot of supply with this strategy . "" bankruptcy because of these new dynamics , there is improved market confidence that california will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for socal edison and pg & e , even as they are set to miss another round of payments to creditors and suppliers today ( remember , there is a standstill agreement among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until feb . 13 ) . we believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost by the court case in front of us district judge ronald s . w . lew in los angeles , which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week , at the latest . in fact , without that political cover it would be impossible to square all the various circles of this crisis . audit results and ballot initiatives markets , bush administration officials , and perhaps utility companies themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200 l to bring all electricity generation back under state control . the threat of a proposition initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the california public utilities commission released in the last 48 hours confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since mid - january . first , the audit of socal edison confirmed that $ 2 billion of the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells power . second , it confirmed that edison electric paid nearly $ 5 billion in profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even while it was going on a debt - issuing binge . the audit of pg & e released late last night was even more damaging : pg & e management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to "" clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis "" by not making deep spending cuts , "" including scaling back management salaries . "" the auditors also questioned the utility ' s decision to funnel some $ 4 . 7 billion of its profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company , which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks . "" basically , they took the money and ran , "" as state senate speaker burton put it yesterday . what appears to be governor gray davis ' grudging acceptance of reality is actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough rate hikes / taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without triggering a new - - and far more damaging - - burst of populist outrage among a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making this all up . there is no doubt that this use of money by socal edison and the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the spirit of the 1996 deregulation law , but that is irrelevant in popular political terms . were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by the court case discussed below , these audits would make settlement extremely difficult . keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key to understanding the very complex game that davis , his advisers and senior legislators are now playing . a ballot initiative would be a potential disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re - establishing full public control over the electric utilities . even if the state and utilities successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during that prolonged period . that ' s something california cannot afford as businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate . court battle thus , legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of the court case in los angeles that socal edison and pg & e are likely to win in mid - february . the court will most likely grant the two utilities $ 12 . 7 billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30 % , california politicians could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start of this extended drama : political cover . davis will then have to rely on his political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the utilities to pass on something less than the full $ 12 . 7 billion debt . pg & e and socal edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they have accumulated since august last year when the puc refused to let them raise prices even as electricity prices soared . the court said the 1996 deregulation law was crystal clear - - when the two utilities had repaid so - called "" stranded costs , "" they were free to begin charging whatever they needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power . although the utilities won this case , the judge stayed his order until february 14 th at the state government ' s request . as that deadline approaches , an intense new negotiating round is under way . on the one hand , political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher electric prices ( "" the courts made me do it "" ) , but on the other hand , they also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would force electricity rates up by about 40 % on top of natural gas bills that have soared by about 300 % since last year . utility companies are playing this card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final bailout . "" we ' ll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in mid - february then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and easily . "" one tactic the state political officials are using , in order to force a settlement , is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the next couple of years . one political official pointed out that they could keep the utilities from receiving their money this year , next year or perhaps even the year after . "" sure , we tell them , they will probably win in court and get that money . eventually . we are making them well aware that unless we have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the supreme court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least . we don ' t think the creditors will be quite that patient .

"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity another ground breaking news alert from rlyc . the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts . one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come . although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year . an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments . the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally . just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company . below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition . the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts . stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years . rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force ! rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards . but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem . rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms . rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations . the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers . this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues . $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances . the problems with traditional money transfer methods with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use . with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets . what is the best way to send remittances ? by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country . the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler . rlyc has already begun filling orders in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months . rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition . rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! ! rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry . rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty . rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars . health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa . this could be an enormous new market for rlyc it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees . experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp . e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member . prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies . relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs . with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top - notch management team to bring it all together , rlyc seems to be headed for sunny skies . this company will not remain below the radar screens of wall street ' s mover shakers or even the average investor for much longer . . . if you are on the lookout for companies that have what it takes to experience rapid growth , but are still trading at rock bottom prices , you should call your financial advisor today about relay capital corp .

"" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims . but now a bona fide wolf has arrived , whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state  * and nobody will believe it . true , california would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated . and even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market , prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators . but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn ' t workable competition in california ' s power market , and that the actions of generators "" gaming the system "" have greatly magnified the crisis . the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand . a rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently  * and very profitably  * short of supply even during periods of low demand , when there ought to be lots of excess capacity . as frank wolak , the stanford economist who also advises the state ' s power grid , has pointed out , an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick . you can ' t tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons , but you can look for circumstantial evidence . and such evidence has convinced mr . wolak that "" generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market ""  * a view shared by a growing number of other researchers . which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy regulatory commission . on wednesday , the commission apparently decided to offer california some relief , and put new price caps in place on the california electricity market . i say "" apparently "" because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all . indeed , the measure was passed on a 2 - to - 1 vote , with william massey  * the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls  * voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual . what ' s wrong with ferc ' s plan ? first , it caps prices only in emergency conditions  * ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no emergency . in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive , in spite of all the evidence that it is not . second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes , offering extensive opportunities for what mr . wolak calls "" megawatt laundering ""  * selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls ( for example , the controls do not apply to "" imports "" from neighboring states ) , then selling it back into the california market . severin borenstein of the university of california energy institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant , generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently : "" i predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again , and they will be pretty inefficient . "" the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan . there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there  * indeed , last fall mr . wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts  * but ferc has ignored all of them . the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn ' t get it , that it just can ' t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real . the uncharitable interpretation is that last week ' s action was meant to fail . the medley report , an online newsletter , calls the ferc plan "" a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to deflect any political fallout "" from the looming disaster . whatever the explanation , the plain fact is that ferc and the administration have yet to offer california any significant relief . 00 fo 04 b 3 blabf visit nytimes . com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the web , updated throughout the day . become a member today ! it ' s free ! http : / / www . nytimes . com ? eta how to advertise - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - for information on advertising in e - mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with the new york times on the web , please contact alyson racer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online media kit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfo for general information about nytimes . com , write to help @ nytimes . com . copyright 2001 the new york times company",ham

"Subject: option pricing discrepancy for j . c . penny transaction amitava and seksan have identified the source of the discrepancy between the option prices calculated by the credit - reserve model and the stand - alone spreadsheet model used in deal pricing . the discrepancy can be traced to differences in input variables of the two models and not to any algorithmic differences . the options being priced are a strip of options on monthly instruments . the credit reserve simulation program calculates the time to expiration by assuming that the option expires on first day of the contract month of the underlying contract , which is a very reasonable assumption . the stand - alone option pricing spreadsheet allows specification of the option expiration date independent of the contract month of the underlying . in the jc penney transaction , the monthly options were assumed to expire in the middle of the contract month , when in reality the underlying monthly contracts expire before the start of their respective contract months . the stand - alone spreadsheet model allows such specifications and it is up to the user to ascertain that the expiration dates entered are legal . at present , seksan is ascertaining that the option contracts involved are in deed monthly options and not a strip of daily options , in which case we would require estimates of intramonth volatilities for both the spreadsheet model and the credit reserve model . regards , rabi de",ham

"Subject: re : amitava ' s visit bryan , i am glad we could help . let me talk to vasant about amitava ' s support for you . vince bryan seyfried 11 / 05 / 2000 05 : 26 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect cc : steven leppard / lon / ect @ ect , markus fiala / lon / ect @ ect subject : amitava ' s visit really appreciate your freeing amitava up to provide critical input into the quantitative work we have undertaken . as you are aware much of the work requires exploring uncharted territory and the team has confirmed the significant contribution that amitava ' s experience and expertise has provided in a very short timeframe . as you might expect , this quickly confirms that we really need more dedicated support from someone with amitava ' s background . it is imperative that we leverage his experience to speed up the process and apply critical insights into our project . this will not only speed up the work considerably but also ensure that we have put our best team on the difficult issues in front of us . i would like to discuss an arrangement where we can ensure amitava is more integrated into our efforts . i realize it will be difficult to free him up but maybe we can put something together which works for everybody . some early ideas : have amitava and family come over for 6 weeks of dedicated support . this should allow us to develop the communication processes to run a global quant effort for the project and then continue with amitava a full time ec . com resource working from houston . this is likely my preference . or agree a schedule of regular trips which allows amitava to provide critical insights and oversight of the project and give our team a resource to extract his experience on an ongoing basis . let ' s discuss before i talk to john about the practicalities thanks for your assistance .",ham

"Subject: re : energy derivatives hi vince , hope all is well with you . i ' m looking forward to seeing you again next week and meeting with grant . can you guys do me favour ? i ' m sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter ? i ' m including what i have already written so that you can see the style . many thanks and best regards . chris . 2 overview of this book this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book . in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated . chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and trade . chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves . what we do in this chapter chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options . chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps . chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style options . chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options . chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also discussed . chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market variables . finally , we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11 .",ham

"Subject: non - firm power curve building hi vince , amitava and i have received a request to build a non - firm power curve for each region from david hoog ' s double trigger folks . the objective , as they explain it , is to allow the desk to buy non - firm from the market , buy david ' s outage product , and sell firm to the market . accountants would like a curve to mark the non - firm position . my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non - firm curve , but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in david hoog ' s court to build the curve if david wants to sell his product internally to the desk . assuming we build the curve , the next issue is how to define "" non - firm "" ? the only way i can think of is to tie the non - firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units . this will allow the purchase of david ' s outage product to cover the non - firmness risk . tying the definition of non - firmness to a whole region seems implausible - - - what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region ? consequently , the non - firm curve takes on a unit - level interpretation , and not a region - level interpretation . consequently , i do not see how we can talk about the "" non - firm curve for the region "" ? we will need to build a non - firm curve for each generation unit or group of units . maybe i could get your thoughts later today . thanks , vasant",ham

"" rather than go through all the hassles they [ dynegy ] had at ferc with the 1998 - 99 package , they let someone else do all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid . that way no one can complain that the procedure was tainted . after all , dynegy has quite a few power plants in california to keep fueled , and all of their current ft on el paso expires at the end of this year . of course , they still could be thwarted if the original negotiated customer matches their bid . it may all sound kind of machiavellian but sort of makes sense . "" other sources heavily discounted the chances of dynegy being the new high bidder , pointing out that the company made significantly less than expected this year because san juan / border basis differentials narrowed significantly . a dynegy source indicated that the company was involved in the bidding and lost to duke in the first round . regardless of what happens next year , a marketer noted that the southern california border / san juan basis spread continues to compress as socal gas withdraws from storage and east - of - california utilities exercise their peaking contracts because of cold weather in the rockies and elsewhere in the west . from a december index spread of 29 cents , the border / basin gap was down to about 18 cents wednesday , she said .",ham
