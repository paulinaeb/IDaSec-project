Subject the storage revolution has begun network world fusion focus  amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today  s focus  the storage revolution has begun 03  07  00 dear wincenty kaminski  today  s focus  the storage revolution has begun by amy larsen decarlo believe the hype  we are in the middle of a storage revolution  virtually overnight  businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to terabytes of data  and the number of users accessing that information is skyrocketing  the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery  it isn   t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that are changing how businesses handle storage  the premium that companies place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound effect on their storage requirements  businesses demand fault  tolerant storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their employees  suppliers and customers  but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements  on average  double every 12 months  while processor speeds double every 18 months  companies are left with a quandary  how can they manage the proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds  the simple answer to this question is to institute a well  executed storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support those needs  bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those systems  there are several ways to efficiently manage storage  one of the best routes is consolidation that is  pooling resources and managing storage as a system  as opposed to a decentralized collection of file servers  this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era  when enterprise storage resided on mainframes  but it   s actually a progressive step  as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing the planning  management  and ongoing support of storage systems than it does with the physical location of the files  next  it is important to recognize that not all information is equally important to the organization  consequently  storage requirements vary by business application  as in all areas of it  it is important to make storage implementation decisions based on business needs  businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for alternatives to the distributed file server storage model  they want to speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth  intensive backup and recovery operations from the lan  network  attached storage  nas  supplies it professionals with one answer  giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to stored data  nas devices  which have been widely available for years  are optimized to process i  o transactions  though they promise better performance  they don   t remove backups from the transport network  instead  they supply a relatively easy  to  deploy solution to cross  platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments  many consider storage  area networks  san  to be the best long  term answer to current and future storage challenges  because sans are designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network  they alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated with more traditional storage models  yet  given the early deployment stage most companies are still in  many of those capabilities are still largely untested in a production environment  this newsletter will examine how  through effective storage management  it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery to their customers  this newsletter will not focus on items like the least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library  instead  it will look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues  ultimately  the goal is to identify storage technology options and practices that work in real  world environments  to contact amy larsen decarlo                                amy

Subject investment  partnership proposal dear sir  i am mr  femi olugbade  a bank executive  i am sending this message to you in confidence  i am asking for your favor in the transfer of some money belonging to one mr barry kelly  deceased  whose death we were not aware of until we no longer got reply to our routine notifications to his forwarding address  we were however told by his employers  that he died from an automobile crash  now all attempts to trace his next of kin has proved abortive  there is however no trace in any of his official documents of a next of kin  the basic line here is that at the expiration of 6 years  the money will revert to the ownership of the government  nobody is ever coming to claim this money having spent 5 and a half years in our bank  so all i am asking from you is that you should stand in as his next of kin to avoid the money going into the hands of corrupt government officials  also note that  it is impossible for the money to leave the coffers of the bank without a next of kin  who also must be a foreigner  further workings of this initiative  and a sharing ratio  plus possible areas of investment will be discussed as soon as i hear from you  best regards  femi olugbade,spam

Subject introduction vince  as way of introduction  i wanted to write a bit about mars inc  and then about cds  the unit i head  mars is a private company  considered to be the largest privately owned manufacturing company in the world  mars is not in the habit of disclosing its finances  so the best i could do is refer to forbes  estimate of  15 billion annual revenue and to the profit margins of similar companies between 5  12   mars is in the business of manufacturing confectionery  m  m  dove bar  skittles  twix   all  r   food  uncle ben rice  r   pet food  pedigree  whiskas waltham  r   and other products  mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that emphasizes the long term goals of the company  part of the philosophy is to look for win  win solutions with its suppliers  customers and partners  as can be understood from the nature of the company  a large chunk of its expenses goes towards purchasing commodity like products  and hence the history of researching those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand  people eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer   cds has a history of few decades in forecasting weather and has been very successful  with an envious track record  in helping mars get a competitive advantage in these arenas  cds is a global group  in 4 countries across two continents  which supports the purchasing function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas  it is a multidiscipline and multinational team with a lot to offer  not having a ready access to the energy markets  and with a risk profile based on manufacturing expertise  mars has decided to look for potential partners in this area  enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to talk to  in talking to enron  we are careful to suggest that mars is not committing to anything at this point  and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to pursue the opportunity we discussed in the future  i am looking forward to our video conference call  kind regards  avi                                        avi i  hauser phd mba cds director 100 international drive mt olive nj 07828  1383  1 973 691 3664  office   1 973 347 8189  fax   1 973 727 3622  car  slow paging  hauser  cdsusa  com,ham

Subject wharton collaborative research here is a short note on potential research with wharton  please review and edit and then we can send some indication to the wharton guys            the objective would be to define the amount of risk an enterprise can take  and the difference between this and the actual amount of risk the enterprise chooses to take based on the capital structure and reporting structure  in particular  one can view enron as a hierarchy of companies  and assuming we can separately quantify the risks of each unit  what framework would one use to analyze risk at enron  a related question is how one should represent risks in the different units  risks may be of different types    short  term volatility risk  catastrophic risk  liquidity risk  etc    what should one focus on for a first cut  another related question is to decide on the optimal amount of insurance both at the unit level and the enterprise level  and relate the decision to get insurance to the cost  benefit of insurance ,ham

Subject re  joe  i have written to pal quilkey to invite christian werner to houston for a week to discuss how much of his research we can use  vince joseph hrgovcic 08  01  2000 06  51 pm to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  mike a roberts  hou  ect  ect cc  subject  vince  i have inquired into christian  s climate models  it seems to me like a long term project  chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than the australian met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and that they are an  old boy  s network  resistant to new developments  but i don  t think the same can be said of most other weather services  as far as the nws goes  they run their model on a cray  they have several very talented phd  s working on it full  time  and even then  they can only get a dozen or so runs per night  in other words  it  s a huge system  replicating something even close to that will not be an easy task  that being said  i think there are related applications that we could look into  since i  ve already promised the rac group and the weather desk  s pjm traders to put together a vector autoregressive model of daily temperatures  i think it makes sense to see if something better than a var model can be put together  perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model christian has  what i have in mind is something that would give us say  up to several dozens of  possible  temperature forecasts every morning  which would be calculated using actual climate models  as opposed to time series models   i would not use this as a forecasting tool  the nws model results would make a far better  best guess    but our ensemble could still be used to provide a distribution of temperature scenarios  this ensemble would have several uses  1  we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a more realistic daily v  r for the weather book  and eventually interface that with the power desk  s v  r calculations  2  we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to week  ahead cdd and hdd distributions  for use in our demand swaps  3  if freese  notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts  e  g    expect the trough to recede  we could sort through the different monte carlo scenarions  find one in which the trough in question is receding  and use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures corresponding to that scenario  up till now  we haven  t found a good way of getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean temperature  wise 4  we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns  the traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen  although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating month  ahead or season  ahead weather  trust me on this  we could still use the visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations  just today  i  ve spoken with dr  jacobsen of stanford university  who has written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting  and who worked with ucla  s general circulation model  he says that getting a simplified version of mm 5  which is itself a simplified  limited  area version of the gcm models that nws  cola  and ucla use  would take several months to implement  assuming the people involved are already well versed in the technology  also  i have contacted aer  a massachusetts  based weather consulting firm  and they tell me that they have a mm 5 model running daily  only one run per night   and also some smaller pc models up and running  they are of course willing to work with us for a fee  their mm 5 version runs on a  200  000 parallel processor  i am open to your suggestions  or objections as the case may be   i  m not sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of enron  and not just the weather desk  i am scheduled to go to boston next week anyway  and would like to use the opportunity to visit with aer  i will of course coordinate any projects with christian  if we get something like this up and running it will be more likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own australian model   joe,ham

www  cybernoon  com  index  html cm takes enron to delhi today monday  april 23  2001  1 the real story of dabhol if a judicial probe  suggested by the committee  is ordered into the enron deal  it could embarrass three governments ranjit bhushan monday  april 23  2001  mseb revenue collections up at rs 968 crore in march  renni abraham the financial express  april 23  2001 godbole   s report unearths absurd calculations  maharashtra could use this to wriggle out of the dabhol project  sucheta dalal it is finally quit india time for enron  though the controversial multinational has denied plans to sell its stake in dabhol power company  dpc   informed sources say that it has sent feelers to china light  power and others to offload its majority holding  getting out of india may be the best course for enron  though it has threatened a fight and invoked political force majeure  the energy review committee headed by madhav godbole will certainly weaken its case  the committee points out that the many   infirmities  8 in the dpc approval process brings into question the   propriety of the decisions  8  it is clear that the  20 m that enron spent on educating india   s policy  makers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of techno  economic appraisal or due procedure with regard to large international contracts  the committee says it is   troubled with the failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on matters relating to dpc  the failure of governance has been broad  across different governments at different points of time  at both the state and the central level  and across different agencies associated with examining the project and at both the administrative and political levels  it strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigned responsibilities is purely co  incidental  8  though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate these infirmities  its two key members  mr godbole  and former secretary in the ministry of finance  eas sarma  have asked for a judicial inquiry into the process of clearing the dpc project  other members felt a judicial inquiry would delay the negotiation process and  serve any purpose  8  there may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiating tariffs or facilitating enron   s exit  but the report certainly provides the central vigilance commission  cvc  with all the grounds that it needs to start an investigation  cvc n vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the deal  especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign  though the political establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry  the cvc can establish whether there are lapses on the part of   government functionaries including political executives  8 and ensure   appropriate action  8 against them  if it is indeed able to establish  it deliberately uses expensive raw material  ignoring world bank warnings   has worked on fanciful demand  supply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions  in fact  the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs 930 crore more than it should every year  this comprises overcharging of rs 253 crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per cent of the capacity is used for dpc  there   s also a rs 100 crore extra billing to the mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge  by charging more than twice the operations  maintenance rate stipulated by the government of india  enron collects approximately rs 246 crore extra every year  it has also been collecting rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims  enron has been charging at 1878 kcal  kwh under the power purchase agreement  ppa  although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate  this gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra  the committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation  a rate of rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans  rs 34  5 per dollar as reference rate for phase  i  rs 39  35 per dollar as reference rate for phase  ii and a curious rs 42 per dollar for calculating government of india tariff  forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation  all it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment  the godbole committee has established that dpc   s tariffs can easily be halved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments  the take  or  pay clause and escrow facility  which is in fact hampering mseb   s reform particularly in power distribution  are scrapped  the security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tariff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system  the committee also gives enron a difficult escape route  it says that if the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous  it should free mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside maharashtra  the committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government    the public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf  8 and has recommended that all documents  including contracts related to all independent power projects  ipps   particularly dpc  should be published by the maharashtra government within two months  also  having established that demand  supply estimates by the state government were fanciful  the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps  it recommends that such negotiations should be in accordance with the least  cost plan spelt out by the report  this should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance  patalganga   mittals  bhadravati   the bses  saphale  and others to set up ipps in maharashtra                                                            the financial express  april 23  2001 dpc board set to authorise president  enron md to issue notice of termination  sanjay jog scrapping of power purchase agreement the board of directors of dabhol power company  dpc   which has already taken an aggressive posture  has proposed to authorise the enron india managing director k wade cline and dpc president and chief executive officer neil mcgregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement  ppa  and transfer of dabhol project in view of continuing default by the state and central governments and maharashtra state electricity board  mseb   the board of directors  which would meet on april 25 in london  also plans to appoint mr cline as its   true and lawful attorney  in  fact  8 and authorise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modifications  top sources told the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline and  or mr mcgregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and central governments and mseb under clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa    in response to the continuing default by the mseb of its payment obligations under the ppa  the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the government of india to honour obligations under its counter guarantee  the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings   8 the company resolution said    consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies  the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa from time to time and at any time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company   8 the resolution added  according to the resolution  the directors  the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually  are authorised and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution  in the name and for and on behalf of the company  against this backdrop  the state government and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the ppa  the state government and mseb sources said that such a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebate  penalty  of rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on january 28 and february 13  the state government and mseb  which reviewed its position on saturday at a meeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh  are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the termination notice to the dpc  the dpc   s move to appoint mr k wade cline as its   true and lawful attorney  in  fact  8 deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficit states  mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding rs 64 crore or the equivalent in foreign currency in any financial year  furthermore  mr cline would be in a position to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to the day  to  day operation of the company   s business or exercise its rights and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the financing agreements                                                           business standard  monday  april 23  2001 dpc seeks ok to exit power project  tamal bandyopadhyay  s ravindran the enron  promoted dabhol power company  dpc  is seeking the approval of its 25 lenders to pull the plug on the  3 billion power project in maharashtra tomorrow  april 23   the meeting has been convened in london at the initiative of the company  the meeting is crucial as the dpc board is meeting on april 25 in london to discuss the issue of serving a termination notice to the maharshtra state electricity board  mseb   dpc cannot go ahead with this unless it gets the go ahead from the lenders  while bankers said the lenders   meeting is about the second phase of the project  which is still under construction  state government officials clarified that since there is only one ppa covering both phases of the project  the lenders   decision will be applicable to the existing phase i also  the second phase of the project involves 1  444 mw generation capacity  whereas phase i of 740 mw is already operational    according to the loan agreement  even if only four per cent of the lenders agree to terminate the contract then dpc can do so   8 highly placed sources in the lenders   consortium said from london  this in effect means that only one lender has to agree for dpc to serve a preliminary termination notice  following the notice  there is a cooling off period of six months for both parties  the mseb and dpc  to find a mutually acceptable solution  which may take the form of a re  negotiated ppa  sources added  sources also said that there are two separate meetings scheduled with lenders  the monday meeting will be attended by all the lenders including multilateral funding agencies like japanese exim bank and opic  the second round of meetings schedule for tuesday will be only with the global loan arrangers anz investment bank  csfb  abn

fate of its 2  184 mw project in dabhol  including winding up of its operations   the top most item on the agenda is to empower dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up operations in the country   state government sources told pti on saturday  when contacted  dpc spokesperson declined to comment on the agenda of the london meeting and added   i will not like to comment on speculations   sources said a team comprising three top officials of maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  including chairman vinay bansal would attend the high  profile board meet  bansal told pti that mseb has decided to give a  fitting reply  and present its case concerning the rs  401 crore penalty that the loss  making board slapped on dpc on february 28  for not generating required power within the stipulated time as per the power purchase agreement  ppa   this london meet comes two days after the international and domestic financial institutions sit together  april 23  to discuss dpc  s future course of action in the wake of non  payment of dues to the tune of rs  223 crore by mseb and also to take into account the aforesaid penalty  over the payment of dues of december 2000 and january of rs  102 crore and rs  111 crore respectively  sources said  both the state government and mseb had offered to make a  protest  payment as per the ppa  but dpc  india  s first fasttrack power project  refused to accept on that condition  currently  enron india holds 65 per cent in the us  900 million dpc project  which includes mseb  s 15 per cent while general electric and bechtel hold 10 per cent each  the controversial  now on now off  project began in 1992 but ran into rough weather after the shiv sena  bjp came to power and was scrapped only to be revived after renegotiating the ppa  fresh trouble arose in october last when mseb began defaulting over the  enormous  billing following which dpc invoked the state and centre  s counter guarantee and also recently sent three international arbitration notices and invoked the political  forced majeure  implying inability to conform towards any financial commitment  dpc had yesterday stated that it had no plans to reduce its stake below 50 per cent but according to enron corp  s chief executive officer jeff skilling the company would be interested in talking to potential buyers for its stake  skilling  according to an international financial daily  said the multinational continues to see strong growth in north america  europe and australia indicating a possibility of exiting from india the financial express  monday  april 23

 at its meeting with the union finance minister yashwant sinha and union power minister suresh prabhu on monday  also proposes for the appointment of a non  indian arbitrator with a view to cutting the cost substantially  during arbitration proceedings initiated by the dpc after the repudiation of dabhol phase  i by the previous shiv sena  bjp government in 1995  a non  indian arbitrator  mr kumara swami was appointed as an arbitrator after a suggestion by a senior counsel fali nariman  state government sources told the financial express that it would write a letter to the dpc regarding arbitration proceedings after monday   s meetings  the state advocate general goolam wahanwati will be suggesting a suitable arbitrator for the state and central government and mseb  the advocate

confirming that there was no proposal from the state government to handover the project to the centre  mr  prabhu said that the situation of the electricity boards in the country was precarious  the

story of dabhol if a judicial probe  suggested by the committee  is ordered into the enron deal  it could embarrass three governments ranjit bhushan  the committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken in respect of the enron project at different points of time by successive governments and agencies in the centre and state     energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole this could well be the real enron story a five  member high  powered committee headed by madhav godbole   and including former union economic affairs secretary e  a  s  sarma  hdfc chairman deepak parekh  teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government official vinay mohan lal   has recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron power project deal saying it signified  the utter failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision  making process relating to the dabhol project   the report  which was submitted to the maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by outlook  is severely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar  with the congress then   the 13  day bjp  led union government which reworked the deal in 1996  shiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra headed by manohar joshi  the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decision  making relating to the dabhol project   madhav godbole committee report an investigation  if ordered  could embarrass at least these three governments the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal  according to the committee  the deal reveals failure of governance  both at the centre and state  and across different agencies   it strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental   the report said  proposing a set of measures to be implemented if something of the project was to be retrieved  godbole and sarma also felt that the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to order a judicial inquiry  this was finally adopted by it  says a congress leader   enron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra and put to question liberalisation  particularly in the power sector   the proposal has already struck panic  says ncp  s praful patel   if the enron decision has at all been detrimental  it is because of the haste with which phase 2 was cleared by the shiv sena  bjp government  now with the state having already entered into an agreement with enron  the important thing is to resolve it amicably  a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it  s not an issue of corruption but that of perception   pro  market congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the centre and the state which invited enron  even though the second phase was cleared by the bjp  shiv sena combine  says congress spokesperson jaipal reddy   right now we  re too involved with the parliament deadlock over tehelka   pro  liberalisation congress mps also fear that such witch  hunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors  non  congress mps from maharashtra  meanwhile  claim that the godbole committee was instituted with the express purpose of politicising the enron issue   i think i know vilasrao deshmukh  s gameplan   says an mp from the state  but some mps like congress  prithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy that  s surrounded the deal   i  ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this  8  the committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected to a techno  economic appraisal  as envisaged under provisions of the electricity supply act of 1948 and related legislations  the infirmities could have been avoided  since this wasn  t done  questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise  the exhaustive 93  page report points out   i  d highlight the speed with which the 13  day vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit   says congress mp prithviraj chavan  the enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early  90 s and  despite several controversies  is now an established power project at dabhol  150 km south of mumbai  in july 1992  enron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  to set up a 2  550 mw station as part of the government  s  fast track  projects  subsequently  when the shiv  sena  bjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a writ against the project  this curiously led to renegotiations with enron  the committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated deal   once it  gom  decided to revive the project  it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done  it forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency  the speed with which the negotiating group studied the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons  which was accepted by dabhol  is unprecedented   says chavan   i would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the 13  day vajpayee government at centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned   since the commissioning of the plant in may 1999  the mseb has paid rs 1  607 crore for the power it has bought from dabhol  if the same watttage of power had been bought from indian  built power plants fired by indigenous coal  the payment would have been approximately rs 736 crore  in the first year  and  a  half of its operation itself  the dpc had drained the maharashtra exchequer of nearly rs 1  000 crore  the central electricity authority  cea   in fact  pointed out that the dabhol plant was not the least costly option  the mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of kaparkheda  but they were in a preliminary stage  the report notes      if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects  they might not have remained in their preliminary stages   it adds that the members were of the opinion that  the mseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously  based on information available at that time  in proceeding with the dpc as a base  load factor even when its capacity was reduced   the failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the union power ministry  finance ministry and the cea  it quotes the cea as saying that since the union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable  no further examination was required strangely  bal thackeray  s shiv sena  when it came to power together with the bjp in maharashtra  filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal  after the new shiv sena  bjp government took over  its cm  manohar joshi  appointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises  actually managing to reduce the tariff  but certain things remained inexplicable  no fresh clearances were required from the cea  which also said that  since no cost increase was involved    fresh formal clearance wasn  t necessary   says the committee   this only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didn  t consider the economic aspects of the project at all  indeed  given the non  availability of any official record of the meeting on june 24  1994  with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december 23  1994  the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discussed at all    the credibility of the shiv sena  bjp government has been seriously questioned   the committee finds it unexplicable  sic  why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from  2  828 million to  2  501 million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committee   the panel observes  says lawyer prashant bhushan   it is strange that the shiv sena  bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal   the committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal   subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc  the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid  while the mseb was in profit in 1998  99  it plunged into huge losses of rs 1681 crore in 1999  2000   significantly  the world bank in 1993 had predicted the system  s inherent weaknesses  in a letter written to the then power secretary  r  vasudevan  a top bank official had said that  after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions  we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the dabhol project  as presently formulated  is not economically justified  and that in  our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb system in 1998  the proposed base  load operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch  as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power   enron  s persistence and the  gullibility  of the indian side can be gauged from high  ranking enron official joe sutton  s letter to a key indian official  ajit nimbalkar   i recently met with the world bank and have been following the articles in the india papers  i feel that the world bank opinion can be changed  we  ll engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the media from here on  the project has solid support from all other agencies in washington   the key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all  for the first time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project  according to the report  the mseb has been one of the better performing boards in the country and has  despite a faulty transmission and distribution  t and d  system  managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis  maharashtra accounts for nearly one  fourth of the gross value of india  s industrial sector  it  s one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent electrification  since  95  the mseb has been adding to its generation   this improvement  which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb  exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was being considered   the report points out  following a policy of cross  subsidy  roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised  but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn  t been much  in fact  the subsidy claim decreased from rs 630 crore in 1995  96 to rs 355 crore in 1998  99  until in 1999  2000 it increased nearly five  fold to rs 2  084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise per unit   from 15 to 41 paise   an increase of 173 per cent   the increase in the subsidy claim by rs 1  729 crore is due to the increase in the gap principally because of the increase in power purchase costs   says the committee  adding   without the dpc and without problems of t and d loss  the mseb could be financially healthy   but can that happen now since enron is here to stay  the committee has come up with some far  reaching recommendations  make public all dabhol  related documents and agreements  restructure the dabhol project itself to bring down the cost of power  restructure dpc financially  allow sale of dpc power outside maharashtra  re  examine ppas in accordance with least  cost plans  and thoroughly reform the mseb  the committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion  the question is  can that be achieved in an unstable political environment  with priya sahgal making of a scam  1992

standard  monday  april 23  2001 mseb revenue collections up at rs 968 crore in march  renni abraham the maharashtra state electricity board  s  mseb  revenue collections in march 2001 stood at a record rs 968 crore  this was largely due to the disconnection drive on defaulter connections   pegged at nearly 20  000 disconnections a month   which resulted in compliance by consumers  with the dabhol power company  dpc  monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table  the mseb has turned to putting its house in order  as if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis  the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record  for instance  mseb has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended march 31  2001  at 45930 units  compared with the previous year  s 45582 units  making it the top seb of the country in this respect  similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at 86  1 up from 84  6 per cent last fiscal  plant load factor is up to 72  78 per cent  compared with 71  7 per cent in 2000  the parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units  which made it eligible for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the government of india carrying a cash award of rs 12  5 lakh  all other power stations in the state  without exception  also fulfill the eligibility criteria for the cash award  a senior mseb official said  similarly  the chandrapur power station became the first power station of any state electricity board to get the iso 9002 certification  a senior mseb official said   earlier mseb was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning  the agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals  while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head  in the recent past  the government has authorised mseb to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials  many of whom  including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions,ham

Subject california update 3  16  01  a source within the generator community confirms press reporting that coram energy plans to file an involuntary bankruptcy early next week  through an intermediary  we were able to corroborate this information with a senior member of the ca iso board  coram energy is a relatively small wind generator qf based in west vancouver  british columbia  though it also owns wind stations in california  coram has 238 40 kw units   the source believes that this filing may have been precipitated by the fact that many people believe it would take a blackout for governor davis to be able to get his bailout plan passed by the legislature  it is unlikely that blackouts would happen in april or may  meaning a long wait for the cash strapped qfs to wait to get paid   the filing will be against socal   in order to file an involuntary bankruptcy  coram would have to file along with at least two other creditors owed  10  000 or more  sources report coram has two other creditors who will file with them  working on finding out who they are    sources also report that other qfs are  taking legal advice  on how to proceed in light of these developments ,ham

Subject california update 1  22  01 executive summary discussions continue today over bill ablx  focus will be on price and term  new legislation introduced today whereby the state will try to save the utilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities  hydro assets in exchange for rate increases  wednesday  state receives bids from auction  rate ranges are expected to be between 5  5 and 8  0 cents per kilowatt hour  mid week  audit findings will be released  audit expected to show pg  e  s utility subsidiary handed over  5 b to the holding company  the holding company used  4  4 b to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock  state commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible bankruptcy scenario  bankruptcy still very possible for both companies  davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue solutions or  bail out   legislation there will be continued discussion regarding bill ablx in the senate today  the discussion will focus on the rate cap of 5  5 cents per kilowatt hour as well as the term  assemblyman keeley  the author  indicated that he believed 5  5 cents was  a fantasy  and impossible to obtain  today  assembly speaker bob hertzberg  d  sherman oaks and assemblyman fred keeley  d  boulder creek will introduce legislation whereby the state would temporary or permanently take both pg  e and edision  s hydroelectric facilities or transmission lines  or both  in exchange for keeping the utilities out of bankruptcy  the state would allow pg  e and edison to impose rate increases  however  the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this month by the cpuc as an emergency surcharge  the money collected from consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state would then enter into long  term contracts with power generators  under the bill  the state of california would control 10  of all california  s electricity  as you can imagine  this legislation has not received unanimous praise  according to recent corporate filings  pg  e  s hydroelectric plants alone would be valued between  3 and  5 billion  this amount just happens to be what davis estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee once the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the  12 billion in debt  davis is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help with about  4 billion in debt  while the utilities  of course  say the full  12 billion should be covered  on wednesday  state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come  davis insists there are already several bids for his 5  5 cents per kilowatt hour ceiling  though few agree with his opinion  a handful of smaller  independent electricity providers with about a 30  share of california power market  indicated sunday night they would come down to  less than eight cents  or less than half of what they currently charge  in return for the stability of long term contracts  because consumers pay about 6  5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current puc rules  any hope california has to  work off  the back debts for these utilities lies in hitting something very close to davis  price cap  without falling back on higher prices for consumers  the level of bids will be particularly important since bond rating agencies moved to put the state of california on a credit watch on friday  worried that there was no obvious long  term repayment plan for the billions of dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state  utility  s audit by the middle of this week  california auditors will release their findings about how much money pg  e and socal edison actually owe to institutions outside their own holding company structure  this will define the limits of what the state will guarantee  if they guarantee any of the debt  the truly explosive part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years  a source with knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last three years  pg  e  s utility subsidiary handed over about  5 billion to the holding company  of that total  the holding company used  4  4 billion to pay shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock  another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current power crisis when regulators  at the time of deregulation  under the direction of former r  gov  pete wilson   forced the two utilities to sell at least half of their power  generating plants  auditors are expected to say that if the utilities still owned all these plants  electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt hour  compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in december and january  bankruptcy the threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities  senior advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility companies that ended in bankruptcy  as all the parties involved hunker down for another intensely political week  they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy  but to push this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an advantage  under such conditions  the risks of one or more of the players fumbling and triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy  is still quite high  california  s political leaders order a series of independent analyses to determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy  the state or the two utilities  the short answer was that no one has any idea  below are the findings of the report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge  1  would the companies be eligible for chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy  some of the advisors thought that pg  e and edison  s finances were so bad that chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option  advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the companies into full liquidation  this would most certainly be guaranteed chaos  2  could the bankruptcy court actually force the puc to raise the price of electricity to consumers  the legal basis for passing on rate increases to consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought  particularly if there is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies  and there is still the question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge  3  if the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets seriously and finds that pg  e and edison cannot afford to buy electricity  he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages  4  if the utilities go into bankruptcy  the first creditors in line would be the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges  the state could become almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier  one of the reasons why suppliers won  t sell electricity on credit to these companies now   5  if the two companies went bankrupt  it would be the largest bankruptcies in history  straining just about everyone involved in the process  6  the corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets from the utility by the ferc for pg  e and already in place for edison may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies currently think  this is particularly true if this week  s audit shows the two corporations transferring billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder dividend payments  davis opinion polls show that governor gray davis is getting high marks for his job  and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits  one of davis concern  s is  according to a senior official in the governor  s office  that a deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so anti  utility and anti  business that it cripples future growth in the state  according to a senior official   no one thought howard jarvis and his property tax initiative would succeed in destroying our education system  but he did  with one just ballot line and a lot of popular revulsion  the threat of direct  popular action is at least as large now as then   consumer advocate harvey rosenfield is already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that individual electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay their debt through higher rate  payer bills  this official goes on to say   the anger at utility companies is so high here  that almost anything rosenfield could think of would pass and we couldn  t do anything about it   this threat has begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always appeared wide open to political leaders   floating a bond issue or a guarantee for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure  and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next several years ,ham
Subject re  progress steve  thanks a lot  i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem  for example  complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality  into the code  regarding tanya  s attitude  just a few points  1  i don  t think she has the skills to do the system administrator  s work and she does not have the necessary privileges  this explains why she keeps asking winston for help  it  s not that the work is beneath her  2  some members of tanya  s team came to me complaining about winston  he effectively told them to go away and work on the  research projects  and that he would take care of the it issues  i don  t think that it  s just tanya  s issue  though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful  3  the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and  or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run  they could not care less about the demarcation line between it and research  they also want tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code  the bottom line is that we are in full agreement  tanya and winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that it happens  credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail  vince from  stephen stock  enron  enronxgate on 01  11  2001 08  23 am to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect cc  subject  progress vince  i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking about some specific solutions to performance of it systems    in particular distributed processing  also i heard that you had concerns about the use of multiple languages etc     both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous occasions    do you feel the need to discuss these further  the multi  language issue isn  t really that much of an issue  as the current system is 98  java right now  although i am a big fan of c  c    it is my main development skill   i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved and robust language  i had serious doubts about the performance  but i  ve had a review conducted  and the results are showing the sun unix implementation to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than c  c   because of something they call hot  spot technology   its an instruction caching technique  i believe   the concerns i expressed to you  were really about how technical people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively meaningless metric like portability  on the issue of distributed processing    the original review i had conducted by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution  and as zhiyong wei is already working on global valuation project  winston is actively working with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that  and also to find a common valuation piece between the systems  i  d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some time over the next few days  also  i sat in on the tanya  winston meeting yesterday and as per our discussion at the elevator  i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code    i  e  seperating research domain problems from it problems  she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were  i asked her how she would measure that  and she said she would instrument the code manually by inserting timing elements at strategic points  i mentioned that a profiling tool could probably do this job for her  tanya again said that stepping through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code  and that studying documentation wasn  t enough  about 6 weeks ago  i commissioned a team to document the system down to psuedo  code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon   in fact i  ve asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now   and winston is also working on a draft research  it  working together  document  which will identify how the exchange of information takes place  tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do all the environment setup for her  because she doesn  t really want to have to do that  i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue  the it guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good  as it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her  she is claiming that they are un  cooperative     they are claiming that she continually asks the same questions about set  up over and over again  and doesn  t seem to want to learn how to do it  winston on the other hand  could be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and an it issue and ask for help from research  i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely  i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together over the next few days     and debbie brackett and i will review their progress on friday  in the meantime l  ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that doesn  t involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer term solution  regards steve,ham

Subject calculating bid  ask prices this is about enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for trading future of a movie  s gross box office receipt  rich sent to many people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide some feedback  i think the idea  see below  might be applicable to other parts of enron  we can call it  dynamic bid  ask price process   in fact  we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is submitted to the system within a specified amount of time  the final  clearing  bid and ask prices are just the last  tentative  price shown to the public before the bidding period ends   so the customers can see the final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish   i think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via enrononline  com   chonawee                       forwarded by chonawee supatgiat  corp  enron on 04  24  2001 07  48 pm                            chonawee supatgiat 04  24  2001 07  40 pm to  richard dimichele  enron communications  enron communications cc  chonawee supatgiat  corp  enron  enron  cynthia harkness  enron communications  enron communications  greg wolfe  hou  ect  ect  james ginty  enron communications  enron communications  jim fallon  enron communications  enron communications  kelly kimberly  enron communications  enron communications  kevin howard  enron communications  enron communications  key kasravi  enron communications  enron communications  kristin albrecht  enron communications  enron communications  kristina mordaunt  enron communications  enron communications  martin lin  contractor  enron communications  enron communications  paul racicot  enron communications  enron communications  zachary mccarroll  enron communications  enron communications  martin lin  contractor  enron communications  enron communications subject  calculating bid  ask prices i think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to forecast it  otherwise  if our forecast is not consistence with the market  we may have an imbalance in the bid  ask orders and we may end up taking some positions  you know  as russ and martin pointed out  we cannot fight with the studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the price easily  one way to ensure the balance of the bid  ask orders is to embed an exchange system inside our bid  ask prices front end  each week  we have a trading period  during the period  instead of posting bid  ask prices  we post  tentative  bid  ask prices  then we ask our customers to submit their acceptable buying or selling price  these  tentative  bid  ask prices get updated and are shown to the public  of course  customers can revise  withdraw their bids anytime during the trading period  at the end of the period  we calculate and post the final bid and ask prices  the seller who submits lower selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price  the buyer who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask price  next week  we repeat the same process  this way  we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we don  t take any position at all  we make profit from those bid  ask spread  we don  t have to worry about forecasting accuracy and insiders  trading because we don  t have to take any position  let the market be the one who decides the price  if we maintain our net position as zero  at the end  when all the actual gross box office numbers are reported in those publications  our customers with open long  short positions are perfectly matched  using the mark  to  market charge can reduce credit risk  thanks   chonawee                       forwarded by chonawee supatgiat  corp  enron on 04  24  2001 07  24 pm                            chonawee supatgiat 04  20  2001 04  31 pm to  richard dimichele  enron communications  enron communications  key kasravi  enron communications  enron communications cc  martin lin  contractor  enron communications  enron communications subject  some more input hi rich and key  again i think your idea is very good  i think that we  as a market maker  can reduce our credit risk  risk of default  if we do the  mark  to  market  charging  that is  each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt  we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market  this way  we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money  in the last paragraph  i think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself  i  e   if there are lots of buyers  our offer price should go up   we can offer other derivative products such as options as well   chonawee,ham

getting an ietf working group started on  my summary of the existing ietf wgs with interests in metrics is given below  appendix b   but it seems unlikely that we could get a new ietf wg started  i believe that we should instead run a single caida working group on  network metrics   rather than the two proposed earlier  my draft of its charter is appended below  it focuses on producing educational material about network measurement  and on developing new metrics  these were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the caida members  the wg co  chairs are sue moon  sprintlabs  and

their networks  by customers for verifying service guarantees  b  what new services are being  or are likely to be  offered  e  g  diffserv  is there a need for higher  layer metrics to better monitor and manage these services  c  will these new differentiated transport  and application  layer services need new metrics  d  how can the service metrics be measured in a multi  isp environment  e  how can customers verify these measurements  f  what requirements would service measurement introduce for equipment vendors  g  how relevant are specific techniques  e  g  which flow  and points of measurement to specific users  isp  customer  etc   requirements  h  how do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived by users  how do they correlate with performance  appendix b  background on the ietf working groups  rtfm wg  realtime traffic flow measurement rtfm is concerned with passive measurements of two  way traffic flows  specified in terms of their end  point attributes  its primary goal was to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the following needs  a  wider range of measurable quantities  e  g  those relating to ipv 6  and to class of service b  simpler ways to specify flows of interest c  better ways to control access to measured flow data d  strong focus on data reduction capabilities e  efficient hardware implementation  ippm wg  ip performance measurement the ippm wg charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can be applied to the quality  performance  and reliability of internet data delivery services  these metrics will be designed such that they can be performed by network operators  end users  or independent testing groups  it is important that the metrics not represent a value judgement  i  e  define  good  and  bad    but rather provide unbiased quantitative measures of performance  rfcs framework for ip performance metrics  rfc 2330  metrics  connectivity  rfc 2678   one  way delay  rfc 2679   one  way packet loss  rfc 2680  round  trip delay  rfc 2681  i  ds bulk transfer capacity  2 x  instantaneous packet delay variation one  way loss patterns  other wgs the rmonmib wg is thinking about  application performance measurement   this is clearly a hard problem  e  g  does this just mean response  time measurement  can it be done by passive means  how should the measurements be presented  etc    in short  rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic volumes  ippm has concentrated on transport  layer behaviour of the current  best  effort internet   rmonmib is beginning to consider application  layer measurement,ham

Subject organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes  these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives  first  we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe  this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position  second  we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships  particularly with joe sutton   s departure  the ability to directly manage the day  to  day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult  third  we need to accomplish these changes without  in any way  compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower  yielding asset positions  and fourth  as always  we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities  enron wholesale services today  we are forming enron wholesale services  ews  which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses  the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following   1  enhanced communication and coordination across business units   2  more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities   3  more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business  and  4  more rapid extension of enron   s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets  enron wholesale services will include our current north american  european  including japan and australia   global markets  and industrial markets operations  and will be expanded to include enron   s net works business unit as well as a new unit   enron global assets  in addition  enron   s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below  mark frevert  currently chairman of each of our wholesale units  will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services  greg whalley  currently chairman and ceo of enron net works  will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer  providing further impetus for these organizational changes  several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions  rebecca mcdonald  currently ceo of enron apachi  will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets  enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron   s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe  joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes  currently coo of enron apachi  rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman  sanjay bhatnagar  currently ceo of enron india  has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region  sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay  in this role  sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman  in addition  sanjay will continue to remain responsible for enron   s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business into enron global assets in the near future  diomedes christodoulou  currently co  ceo of enron south america  has joined ebs as chief commercial officer  diomedes will be located in london and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities  with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors  diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman  jim bannantine  currently co  ceo of enron south america  will be joining ees to lead ees   commercial efforts outside north america and europe  in order to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities  jim will remain in south america for at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south america  throughout the transition  jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services  following the transition  jim will join ees  in addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities  we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions  enron net works louise kitchen will assume greg   s previous responsibilities as president and ceo of enron net works  reporting into mark and greg  enron americas concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for operating enron   s south and central america asset base  all trading  marketing  and new asset development activities in these regions will report into a new entity  enron americas  enron americas will have responsibility for all wholesale merchant businesses across north  central and south america  dave delainey  president and ceo  and john lavorato  chief operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron americas  enron europe the enron europe organization  which includes enron   s businesses in australia and japan  and enron metals  remains unchanged under the leadership of john sherriff  president and ceo  and michael brown  chief operating officer  enron global markets enron global markets  under the leadership of mike mcconnell  president and ceo  and jeff shankman  chief operating officer  will continue to have responsibility for enron   s middle east and lng operations  with the exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico  all operating power plants and associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to enron global assets  enron global markets will also continue to manage the commodity businesses in crude and products  coal  weather  insurance  equities  interest rates  foreign exchange  and agricultural products  enron industrial markets enron industrial markets   organization  under the leadership of jeff mcmahon  president  ceo  and ray bowen  chief operating officer  remains unchanged  commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with  and be managed by  the individual business units  we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews  and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews  to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units  these newly defined roles are as follows  mid and back office operations   sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews  these services will become part of enron net works  with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey  executive vice president and chief accounting officer  this alignment creates a coordinated services organization with it and e  commerce platforms to support the wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these services  mid and back

haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews  regulatory and government affairs   this function will remain organized on a regional basis  rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in the americas  and mark schroeder  who is based in london  will support all european and eastern hemisphere operations  rick and mark will also continue to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions and will continue to report to steve kean  executive vice president and chief of staff  public relations   this function is also organized primarily on a regional basis  eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity  enron net works  and enron industrial markets  jackie gentle will continue in her role for enron europe  including

organization continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes  enron global exploration and production and enron wind as part of our company  wide initiative to examine our assets and investments around the world  we are considering a variety of options with respect to egep and ewc  as a consequence  we are putting these businesses under cliff baxter   s direction  jeff

Subject pserc denver meeting vince  the pserc meeting lance and i went to was both interesting and boring  pserc has 11 school members and 30 industry members  its research program consists of three stems  markets  transmission and distribution  and systems   enron  s interests probably lie mainly in the first stem   in morning of the first day  researchers from universities presented their project proposals  i found some of them quite interesting  for example  shmuel oren  fernando alvarado  tim mount  of cornell  propose to study  market redesign  incorporating the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market design   shijie deng  s  oren et al propose to study  power asset valuation model in a market  based and reliability  constrained electric power system   the first got funded but the second did not  in the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their own discussion  i went to the academic discussion and lance the industry one  i hope my presence there did not make things worse  for the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion  the proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants  the proposal process goes as follows  researchers first write a short proposal to appropriate stem committee  no industry participantion  it seems to me   each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4  the selected proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry  industry then gets to vote which proposals get funded  however  some researchers were very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process  there were accusation of self  ranking  communication between stem committee and member schools breaking down  and so on  some were even asking for some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before wrting it  the arguement was  then it was a waste of our time to write proposals   which i found quite amusing   all in all  i found the process was not taken seriously enough by university researchers  pserc has been established for 5 years now and it still does not have a proper proposal screen process  which is hard to believe  also  the communication among university researchers  between stem committee and member schools  and most importantly  between researchers and industry  are not smooth as all  since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members  the  right  projects may not get funded  too many participants also make the decision process very indecisive and quite painful to watch  lance can comment on this better   they also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which made the voting a less authoritive  i believe enron will not get much returns from join pserc  price tag is  40  000 per company per year   if we find some projects interesting  we can sponsor the schools in the form of summer interns  the schools claim that most of the fund goes to support students anyway  alex,ham

Subject extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe  cera insight title  extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe url  http    www 20  cera  com  eprofile  u  35  m  2184 overview  a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern europe is bringing the region in line with the european union   s gas directive  this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by 2004   05   czech republic  estonia  hungary  poland  and slovenia   and for candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the decade   bulgaria  latvia  lithuania  romania  and slovakia  in cera   s view current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an investor   s point of view  the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the implementation of the eu gas directive during a two  day workshop held by the european commission and the world bank in paris in november  many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy  the results have been mixed  particularly in the utility industries  the 1998 gas directive  adopted in august 2000  now offers a compelling incentive for eu candidate countries to transform their gas industries  while providing a road map to guide them  the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and candidate countries include the following   legal framework and regulation  the legal framework is the cornerstone of enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe  as a result  in all candidate countries in 1999   2000 energy laws were either updated or newly established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive  regulatory bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country  although issues of staffing  financial autonomy  and independence from political influence are not uniformly resolved   third  party access  tpa  and long  term take  or  pay contracts  all candidate countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition  therefore  all have adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation  although the commission favors regulated tpa  the specific approaches to tpa enforcement in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases  in particular  the implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long  term take  or  pay contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies and somewhat preempt competition  russian gas is for the most part sold to single  traditional state  owned operators that dominate their internal markets  a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant players and the competitive environment  this is made more complicated by their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange for transit rights to west european customers  article 25 of the directive provides for  a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take  or  pay obligations  this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry  furthermore  article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only one major gas supplier  to those with an     emerging gas market status      or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another member state  most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the european union   price cross  subsidies  residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers  in various countries  tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have been scheduled  but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce  this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of imported gas to oil prices  all candidate countries have set legal frameworks that include the phasing out of cross  subsidies as part of sector reform  but the actual implementation will remain politically difficult  as table 1 indicates  price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected to enter the european union by mid  decade  but the legal framework itself cannot guarantee the pace of reform  the same goes for candidate countries that have only recently introduced eu  complying energy laws and whose entry to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame   unbundling  most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of liberalization  to date  unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries  in the future  the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal separation    structural unbundling  8  of the businesses  and candidate countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly  table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries  as the table shows  the countries belonging to the second group have only very recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the directive  whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries scheduled for the first wave    end   follow above url for full report  come shoot the rapids with us at

Subject re  marketpoint license agreement dale  thanks for your message  in our phone conversation before the meeting you mentioned another contractual arrangement under which we could work with your company employees on a case  study  the cost of a weekly project would be  12  000 that would be applied to the purchase price should we go ahead and decide to acquire the software  this project would allow us to evaluate the model and come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support the model internally  please  let me know more about this option  we are primarily interested in a long  term natural gas model and the database for north america  unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite  we don  t have resources to spend too much time on it  of course  a trading desk may be interested in the short term version of the model  i shall talk to them about it  vince  dale m  nesbitt  on 11  13  2000 06  00  05 pm to    vince  j  kaminski  cc  subject  marketpoint license agreement john  vince  i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross section of your people  thank you very much for setting it up  and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people  as i mentioned to john  i am sending you the license paperwork for marketpoint  i have attached our standard license agreement for your consideration  as i mentioned  the license agreement covers the entire bundled product  which includes  north american gas  short and long term  north american electricity  short and long term  world gas  western european gas  world oil we are just finishing porting the world oil  world gas  and western european gas models over from our old  now obsolete  software system into marketpoint  so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of months  however  the gas and electricity models for north america are presently complete and tested  that should allow us to give you an attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout your worldwide business  as i understood it  you will want the gas modeling capability first and will want to defer decisions on electric or other capability  as i mentioned at the meeting  we are prepared to offer that for approximately the fully bundled price  as you read the license agreement  you will see that the software licenses for  100  000 annually  the gas data for  5  000  and the electric data for  10  000  marketpoint will agree to license you the gas model plus the data for the software license plus the data license for a total of  55  000 annually  this is just under the fully bundled price  i think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting  and from marketpoint   s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward together with enron  if or when enron ever desires to   scale up  8 to another model or model  s  from the marketpoint portfolio  we will simply scale you up to the entire license agreement  this will allow you to decouple the gas decision from any other decisions you might make   i will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward   i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy  scope  and operation of our approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs  i thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same time its simplicity and effectiveness  i thought you were able to see the benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use  i would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues  i look forward to your response and to moving ahead together  we view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business  if you decide to license marketpoint  we can arrange to transfer and mount marketpoint and the short term narg model  which is the model we suggest you begin with  and travel to houston to deliver our 1 day training seminar  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 day training seminar  thereafter  we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a few weeks while you get up to speed  very fluent  and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks later  thanks again  and all the best  if there is some item from the meeting that i might have forgotten to send  please remind me  my notes don  t show anything  but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted  dale nesbitt president marketpoint inc  27121 adonna ct  los altos hills  ca 94022  650  218  3069 dale  nesbitt  marketpointinc  com  license  doc,ham

Subject combinatorial auction  jan 11 mtg background      forwarded by greg woulfe  enron communications on 12  28  00 09  58 am      chonawee supatgiat  enron 12  22  00 05  08 pm to  stinson gibner  hou  ect  ect  greg woulfe  enron communications  enron communications cc  subject  combinatorial auction stinson and greg  i have read the paper  combinatorial auction with multiple winners for universal service  from richard steinberg and frank kelly  they propose a combinatorial auction which is an auction for multiple items that allows bidders to realize their synergies on combinations of items  the combinatorial auction is appropriated for bandwidth commodity because most bidders in the market have synergies on the combination of items  for example  if we want to get bandwidth between boston and dc  we would bid for boston  ny and ny  dc  it will be valuable to us only if we won both links  if we won only one link  it will be useless  in the paper  they propose the auctioning method but their method has not been tested or validated yet  i have not checked their proposition mathematically but their paper was published in management science so i think it should be all right  i will look at it in more details and let you know  anyhow  there are also other combinatorial auctions that are actually used  for example  the alberta government  s ppa auction that enron canada was participated 3  4 months ago  based on our long position on bandwidth  auction and exchange might be a good channel to dispose our unused  or unsold  bandwidth  i know there is not much demand in the market  but if we open a combinatorial auction or exchange  we might be able to increase our market share   by taking demand from our competitors   i believe  at the moment  there are no bandwidth exchanges that allow  combinatorial  bids  if we are the first one to do it  we might improve our sale channel and gain some market share   note  auction   one seller and many buyers  exchange   many sellers and many buyers   moreover  i think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we cannot sell them anyway  in addition  we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in the system and bid in the auction  if the current wining bid is too low  we can just over  bid it and keep the product  this way  we can indirectly put a reserve price on the products  let  s meet sometime in the first week of january   chonawee,ham

Subject re  spreadsheet for george posey vince  here is an analysis of the fund giving at the church  first off  it appears from the data that a special  appeal  for fund giving was made  from the pulpit   on april 19  1998 and april 25  1999   perhaps tied rhetorically into income taxes    then  by going back and incorporating obvious dates from the calendars for 1997  1999  the following regression analysis is made  where each effect is added independently  giving this sunday   4403  a minor  3 weekly time trend  i  e   multiply by the number of weeks since jan  5  1997   no pure effect from last week  s contributions  i  e   denies first  order autoregressive effects    2426 if easter sunday or the sunday nearest christmas   9695 if  pastoral appeal  april 19  1998 or april 25  1999   340 if the sunday falls on the weekend of a monday federal holiday   50 if the sunday following thanksgiving   73 if a summer weekend  june 1 thru august 31  the pure time trend is very small  so an annual projection based on all 3 years data would be for giving to increase only a minor amount   150  for 2000 assuming a similar appeal for giving is made this april  clayton,ham

safety and fuel cell markets  viaspace target markets are in excess of  100 b  yr and growing with a cagr of over 20   in the past six years viaspace has created three companies  spectrasensors  qwip technologies and vialogy corp  their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology   spectrasensors  com  qwip  com  vialogy  com   the company  s current focus is on three subsidiaries  direct methanol fuel cell  arroyo sciences and ionfinity  direct liquid methanol fuel cell direct methanol fuel cell corporation  dmfcc  will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow  s fuel cell  powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones  methanol fuel cells  dfmc  are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices  a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs  2 to  3  a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks  we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating  as a disposable product  it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc  the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents  toshiba  nec  sanyo  and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology  dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers  arroyo sciences  inc  arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency  nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation  supply chain  security  logistics assurance and first responder safety markets  the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments  this product combines radio frequency identification  rfid  tags  wireless digital communications  ground positioning satellite  gps   data for 2  d and 3  d geolocation determination  geographic information system  gis  and sensor technologies  real  time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger  applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations  improved coordination of multi  agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments  the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports  power plants  airports  and telecommunication facilities  real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe  deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x  ray and gamma ray imaging  arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo  ionfinity ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry  ms  technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms  with a 10 times increase in mass range  higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological  chemical and nuclear contaminants  the current market for ms is estimated at  1  2 billion annually  the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market  new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband  epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up  additional projects under review projects not included in our forecast are  1  a water purification technology and  2  interactive radio  the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish  sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra  pure water  the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance  the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast  the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus  forecasts and valuation we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by  1  increasing wireless usage of computing devices and  2  the existing need to extend cell phone battery life  we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to  195 million by 2009  homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences  which will begin to generate revenues in 2005  and will grow to  90 million in 2009  we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007  and will be  10 million in 2009  beyond 2009  total revenues will grow at a 60  to 80  rate for several years from existing and new products  contracting with existing manufacturers  we expect operating margins will be in the low 40  range by 2009  our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from  8  40 to  11  10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe  the graph below outlines our valuation

uncertain future    after six years  profit from company  s power operations remains years away by elizabeth williamson 04  13  2000 the wall street journal europe 9  copyright  c  2000  dow jones  company  inc   nowa sarzyna  poland   from a small power plant humming among the birches near the ukrainian border  enron corp  has staked its claim on the polish energy market  yet after six years  the company is still seeking a mother lode  the houston  based energy producer and trader entered poland in 1994  nabbed one of the first power  trading licenses to go to a foreign company and began work on elektrocieplownie nowa sarzyna  poland  s first new  foreign  operated heat  and  power plant  other companies followed  including electricite de france  rwe ag of germany  vattenfall ab of sweden and tractebel sa of belgium  the prize could be a rich one  all of these companies hope to profit as poland sells its state energy assets and frees prices before joining the european union  a wholesale power bourse is due to open in warsaw in july  and the country  s transmission links to markets east and west could make poland the power  trading hub of central europe  but after six years in poland  enron has yet to earn a profit  net income from nowa sarzyna  which is to begin commercial production later this month  is at least five years away  power  trading operations might generate profits next year  if the new bourse gets moving  but that is  one big question mark   says jarek astramowicz  enron poland  s president  indeed  despite its promise  poland  s energy sector remains a sizzling tangle of aging plants  archaic market agreements and complex  shifting regulations  enron  with  40 billion  41  69 billion euros  in annual revenue  is an innovator and an investment bellwether for its peers  but in a power market as negatively charged as poland  s  the company also is an example of how shaky market conditions can keep even the savviest competitors offline   these are very large operations and to some extent they can bear some risks   says pawel kaminski  energy  sector operations officer at the world bank in warsaw   but eventually they have to generate some return   enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the u  s  it entered europe in 1989  setting up in london as the u  k   s energy sector liberalized  it entered the nordic market in 1996  and today is the nord pool  s largest  volume trader  enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits for a power plant  and a further 29 months for construction  just four years after entering the u  k   enron finished its 1  875  megawatt teesside plant  teesside  s capacity and cost  at gbp 795 million  1  32 billion euros   are many times larger than nowa sarzyna  s  yet teesside was completed in only two  thirds the time  the company declines to compare development times in various countries   i wouldn  t necessarily put poland into the same category as russia   says philip davies  regulatory and government  affairs manager at enron europe in london   but obviously  given poland  s  planned economy  past  it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process and get to the starting point   at nowa sarzyna  it took enron nearly twice the usual time to reach the starting point  even though mr  astramowicz already knew the site  and the polish power industry  s rules  the nowa sarzyna plant was mr  astramowicz  s brainchild  and he burned out the engine in his first bmw as he traveled between warsaw and the town to craft the deal  a freelance energy  sector entrepreneur before joining enron  mr  astramowicz sold his interest in nowa sarzyna to enron in 1998  enron has spent  132 million to build nowa sarzyna  a 116  megawatt  gas  fired combined heat  and  power plant  quiet  clean and efficient  the plant stands in stark contrast to most of poland  s belching  coal  fired behemoths  when it starts up this month  it will sell its electricity to the polish power grid  the country  s high  voltage network  under a 20  year power  purchase agreement  or ppa  that enron won in 1997  steam output goes to organika  the chemical company next door  and helps heat the town of nowa sarzyna  the nowa sarzyna plant is more than 80  financed by commercial  bank loans for which the only collateral is the plant  s concluded contracts   they were betting on their good name   says michael davies  a partner with allen  overy  the warsaw law firm that advised enron poland  s lenders   they are pushing envelopes all the time   that is especially true in a market with 30  overcapacity  where an energy law didn  t even exist until 1997  says peter bisztyga  emerging europe utilities analyst at solomon smith barney in london   because enron signed a ppa  they are ok     but  i  m really not sure building nowa sarzyna was such a good idea   mr  bisztyga says enron could have generated a faster return by renovating an existing power plant  but  he acknowledges  nowa sarzyna  allowed enron to get into the polish market early and stamp their name on it   in 1994  polish power plants weren  t for sale  energy asset privatization  discussed for years  began in earnest only this year  by 2002  the polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of power plants  33 distribution companies and the polish power grid  a 12  000  kilometer national transmission network of high  voltage lines  the assets have a total book value of 33 billion zlotys  8  4 billion euros   but murky regulations have driven prices down   the regulations don  t promote competition and so you don  t really know the price of electricity   says bengt wegemo  president of vattenfall poland  earlier this year  vattenfall paid  235 million for 55  in warsaw  based elektrocieplownie warszawskie  promising  340 million in investment in the heat  and  power plant over the next 10 years  investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing  ultimately  170 licensed energy traders and 200 large power users will trade on the bourse  setting the wholesale price of electricity  the polish bourse will be modeled on its nordic counterpart  enron  the nord pool  s largest trader  hopes to post polish trading profits by 2001  but first  say market experts  poland  s 1997 energy law must be amended to ease functioning of the bourse  and free up access to poland  s distribution network  further  the government says it must solve the competition problem posed by the polish power grid  s power  purchase agreements  which account for 70  of energy sales in poland  some state  owned plants used the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing  when prices are freed  these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete with plants that didn  t spend money to modernize  the government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the modernized plants for their extra costs  though nowa sarzyna is a private plant  the price enron must charge for its power is about twice what outmoded plants charge   we are hoping that continuous  efficient operation of the plant will generate us a  bigger  profit   mr  astramowicz says  another problem is cross  border power trading  where contradictory legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the polish power grid  also known as pse  enron and others protest that pse shouldn  t compete with electricity  market participants who contract with it for transmission service  pse intends to stay in the trading business  says marek zerka  pse  s vice president  in late march  pse and local company kulczyk holding signed an agreement with preussenelektra ag of germany to export electricity and coal to eu countries via germany   this is great news   mr  astramowicz says   if this joint venture gets access to pse  s cross  border transmission capacity    i would expect pse to confirm open access to all market participants   enron and others are pushing hard for that access   as soon as the market becomes open  free and non  discriminatory  we will come out at a decent profit   mr  astramowicz says  folder name  enron in europe relevance

Subject alex tartakovski as you may know  we are trying to schedule an interview for alex tartakovski in houston this week  i am copying everyone involved because i wont be able to coordinate this tomorrow  we just brought our new daughter home today and my wife is yelling at me to get out of my office  i just found out that thursday  friday are bad days for him  so wednesday is the only day to do it this week  he would come down tuesday night and fly out wednesday evening  it  s probably easiest for him to arrange his flight  but he will need a hotel and transportation from the airport  i gave him donna  s phone number for help  i assume the hyatt would be best  his home number is 215  702  3705 and during the day his cellular is 267  981  5425  by way of background  i plan to bring in 3 people from outside the company to fill in some of the  vacants  in my group  s org chart  the 3 areas of specialization that are needed to execute the business plan are  1  coordination of origination   2  deal pricing and underwriting  and  3  modeling and portfolio management  alex is the perfect person for  3  he has the deepest knowledge of probability of anyone i know and is efficient at building analysis models  which will be a big job in this business because portfolio management needs to be redefined in real time due to the lumpiness of insurance contracts and the lack of any historical methods for evaluating these risks  development of pricing models will be a joint effort between  my  group and the research dept because this will need to draw on the expertise in research as well as being a realtime activity as new deals are being structured  i want to encourage joint work between vasant  amitava and alex because his background and expertise is compatible with research  over the past 2 years  alex and i spent a lot of time developing new electricity spot pricing methodology and this is one area where he excels  i would expect that he would be a valuable resource in research as well  and so i would like for him to be able to meet with vince is possible   this could possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time      depending on what work needs to be done in the future  i could see him working both on pricing research and this specific business unit  i have attached alex  s resume  i assume he would be manager level  but i  m not sure of this  this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume  but the skills that are useful to us are  probability  statistical model development development of theoretical pricing methodology excellent computer programming skills database development and data analysis he has the best understanding of the nerc reliability data format outside of mike curley  the nerc data manager  designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by ace power products for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt  excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to hedging insurance portfolios  if you want to get into superconductor trading  he can design the standards  can beat me at atari battlezone  as well as being able to navigate a real tank through a minefield   one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with the organization  with which you did such a good job for me  and to give him confidence that he will be able to do state  of  the  art pricing research in the most innovative company in the world  he is also interviewing for a job in morgan stanley  s equity dept  we will also arrange a meeting with per in ny  but i would like to be in the office for that  so we can do that next week  please call me  610  996  2522 if there are any questions  i may not pick up but i will reply to voicemail promptly  i  m up 24 hours this week anyway  thanks    dave,ham

empowers md to cancel mseb contract the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb  the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue  notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power  was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party  the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi  sources said  according to reports  financial institutions such as anz investment bank  credit suisse first boston  citibank  abn  amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb  mseb chairman vinay bansal  who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra   s 15 per cent stake in the near  3  billion project  said   the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract   while bansal declined comment on the board decision  the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state   pti  the economic times  friday apr 27 2001 mseb pays rs 134 cr under  protest  to dpc despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head  maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a  protest payment  of rs 134 crore disputed amount  towards march bill of rs 146  64 crore to dabhol   we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself  but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh   a senior mseb official said   we have disputed payment of rs 12  64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum  of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members   mseb sources said  last week  dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept  protest payments  anymore  cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums  which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the  purported protest or reservation   mseb had paid a rs 113  5 crore february bill in protest last month  on april 23 last  both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational  s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government   pti  business standard  friday  april 27  001 enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enron  promoted dabhol power company  dpc   at its meeting in london on wednesday  authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government    the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice  however  this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately  it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises   8 a state government source told business standard from london  he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders  the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue  the hardening of the board   s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc  s lenders  who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice  the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage  serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders  who have an exposure of about  2 billion in the project  sources said given the lenders  strong opposition to termination of the contract  the enron board  s  enabling resolution  did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio  the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice  the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract  enron holds 65 per cent in dpc  while us  based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each  the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle  maharashtra power development corporation  the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party  the idbi representative protested against the board  s decision  the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal  the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills  after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill  dpc invoked the state government  s guarantee and then the union government  s counter guarantee  when payment of the rs 127  crore january bill became overdue  dpc again invoked the state government  s guarantee  mseb retaliated on january 28  2001 by slapping a rs 401  crore penalty for non  supply of electricity at adequate levels  it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty   this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting   a state government official said  the centre also supported mseb  s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee  the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause  a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on  the financial express  friday  april 27  2001 foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc  sanjay jog  raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pull  out lenders to the dabhol power company  dpc  are a sharply divided lot  international lenders  in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india  idbi   are categorical that additional assistance to dpc   s phase  ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work  the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  within the next four weeks  this follows the authorisation given to enron india   s managing director k wade cline and dpc president  ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice  and transfer notices to mseb  following wednesday   s dpc board meeting in london  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is  emotions do not work  contractual obligations and payments have to be met  we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations  there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it  the structuring of dpc   s debt has created two classes of lenders  in phase  i  international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase  ii  no lender is  however  all lenders have a parri passu charge  making attachment of assets a messy affair  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase  ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security   other than assets   like a sovereign cover    it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16  5 per cent from 21  5 per cent   8 a leading foreign banker pointed out  three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were  a  there are contractual obligations b  mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c  mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power  while local lenders led by idbi   with mseb parroting the same   were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one  international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out  this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for  international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form  the points of contention are  a  that phase  i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b  phase  ii is not and c  to the extent that phase  ii is covered by assets  cancellation of phase  ii may see all assets   even those under phase  i   getting attached  therefore  an examination on the segregation of assets under phase  i and phase  ii is now warranted  pti adds  in a significant move  dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb  a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre  a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday  the indian express  friday  april 27  2001 enron  dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company  a subsidiary of houston  based enron corp  has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar  based project  in a board meeting held in london on wednesday  the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india   s managing director k wade cline to serve a     preliminary     termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks  the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year  mseb owes dabhol power  48 million for power delivered in december and january  the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed  but mseb has paid  24 million for february  and a payment of  31 million was made for march on thursday  the  3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date  issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes  while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron  analysts have described the decision as a     procedural     move consistent with dpc   s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice  step two would be an official termination notice  and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project  if the project is terminated  the government of india will have to take a hit of  300 million besides paying bills of rs 1  500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty      our  centre   s  liability  if dabhol power project is terminated  would be one year   s electricity bill and a termination fee of  300 million      power secretary a k basu said      contractually  the centre will have to pay one year   s electricity bill  totalling at present prices about rs 1  400  1  500 crore  and take over dpc   s debt  which stands at around  300 million  if the project was terminated      basu said in delhi  dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2  184  megawatt power  plant project  which is 95 per cent through  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project  indian lenders  led by idbi  are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice  during the meeting in london  mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project  had strongly opposed dpc   s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar   both directors on the dpc board   and the state principal secretary  energy  vm lal  an invitee to the board  raised the issue at the board meeting in london  mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly     threatening     to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation  in recent weeks  dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb  delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra   a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war  coup  or a similar radical political event  in this case  dpc   s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity  dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power  critics object to the company charging rs 7  1 a kilowatt  hour for its power  compared with around rs 1  5 a kilowatt  hour charged by other suppliers  the hindu  friday  april 27  2001 offer of renegotiation  too late   enron  by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai  april 26  the enron  sponsored dabhol power company  which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement  ppa  with the maharashtra state electricity board  has decided to keep a stiff upper lip  this  in turn  has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent  while in reality  a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu    it is not sudden death of the project   and in all probability  the dpc  vexed with the developments  including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee  has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option    this would only eventually come into effect  it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved    apparently  the dpc intends to do some arm  twisting  at the board of directors meeting in london  which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project  the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather   too late    it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome  it did not  however  rule out the option of talks  thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon  the maharashtra chief minister  mr  vilasrao deshmukh  had hoped that dpc would not take any   harsh step   which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay  in fact  the mandate of the team that went  on the strength of its stake in the dpc  was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation  echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister  mr  suresh prabhu  said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs  2  840 crores  whose liability in the project agreement was limited  the centre  s liability in case of termination is one year  s electricity bill and a termination fee of  300 million  blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions  fis  which  under the leadership of the idbi  were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice  the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state  the times of india  friday  27 april 2001 enron ready to pull out  but lenders say wait the dabhol power company board  which met on wednesday in london  authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board  the company  however  may not pull out of the project yet  considering its lenders  who met on monday  opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations  sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue  domestic financial institutions  led by the industrial development bank of india  prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move  enron needs the lenders  consent to file a pre  termination notice for pulling out from the project  the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms  institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package  which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project    the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre  termination notice  but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re  negotiation proceedings    said mseb chairman vinay bansal  who attended the board meeting    mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings    we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable   bansal added    they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction    said a top banker who was present during the lenders  meet    there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance    he added  the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank  credit suisse first boston  abn  amro  citibank and the state bank of india  where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials  however  some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings  meanwhile  in a clear reversal of roles  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa    we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us  including dpc    deshmukh said  deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu  s sentiments  who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row  he  however  added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments  and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the  2  9 billion project would be a blow to india  s efforts to woo foreign investors  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non  payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001  meanwhile  mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment  despite the dispute over the amount  when asked on the future course of action  bansal said it was up to the dpc  the hindu businessline  friday  april 27  2001 dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice the board of directors of dabhol power company  dpc  has authorised the managing director  mr neil mcgregor  to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement  ppa  with the maharashtra state electricity board  mseb    at an appropriate time    the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday    while mseb  which is an  interested party   was not allowed to vote  it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter    a senior state government official said  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one  idbi voted against the decision  the official said  the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six  month   suspension period    according to clause 17  8 of the termination procedure  of the ppa    following the giving of a preliminary termination notice  the parties shall consult for a period of six months  or such longer period as they may agree  as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances      idbi and state bank of india  the principal indian lenders  had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time  at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice  it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent  however  domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid  way  according to institutional sources  indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues  the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation  mr vilasrao deshmukh  chief minister of maharashtra  yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated  mr yashwant sinha  union finance minister  is also understood to be of the same opinion    the dpc will now have to decide what is the  appropriate time  to serve the notice    the official said  mseb pays rs 134 crore  meanwhile  mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill  mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid  in protest   today morning    they  dpc  had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore  we do not agree with some of the items included    a senior mseb official said  the pioneer  friday  april 27  2001 enron testing maharashtra  s nerves  t n raghunatha dabhol power company  dpc  has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board  mseb   the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them  if the dpc board of directors  decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication  the dpc board  in its meeting in london on wednesday  empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb  a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2  840 crore on the centre  the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of  interested party   when contacted  the company  s mumbai  based spokesperson  mr jimmy mogal  declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board   we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london  we will express our views after a few days   he said  however  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board  s decision as  unfortunate    we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision   mr deshmukh said in mumbai  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board  s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay  through its tough posture  the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re  negotiations with the mseb  the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board  the sources said that the dpc  s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb   if anything  the dpc  s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb  as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control  the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb  the centre and the state government   the sources said  not surprisingly  the dpc  s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government  s decision to set up a high  level committee  comprising representatives of the mseb  the centre and the state government to re  negotiate with the enron  s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board  meanwhile  amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head  the mseb on thursday made a  protest payment  of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146  64 crore to dpc  riday  april 27 the telegraph  friday  april 27  2001 enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy  ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company   s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board  mseb   the meeting of the company  of which the houston  based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent  was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination  the centre   s liability  if enron decides to snap the agreement  will be a year   s power bill and a termination fee of  300 million  however  the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug  the centre shrugged off the move  saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out    we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit   8 power minister suresh prabhu said  mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc  which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings  the decision coincided with a rs 134  crore   protest payment   by the cash  strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146  64 crore  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron   s hub in houston  and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head  mseb officials brushed away the allusions  saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state  wide bandh    we have a disputed payment of rs 12  64 crore  which will be taken up at the dispute  resolution forum   8 a board official said  last week  dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric  the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc  are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk  investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre   s and state   s counter  guarantees  unlike those made by international lenders  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron   s decision unfortunate    we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties   8 the statesman  friday  april 27  2001 enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director  mr k wade cline  to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the  2  9 billion power project  the decision  which could lead to the cessation of dabhol   s power supply to the state  was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board  mr vinay bansal  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything  it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting  mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president  mr sharad pawar  and union power minister mr suresh prabhu  who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister  mr vilasrao deshmukh  and an mseb delegation last monday  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter  guarantee  further  the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step  the union power minister  mr suresh prabhu  contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0  7 per cent of the total energy output of the country  its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation  however  if terminations proceedings go through  enron corp  a 65 per cent share  holder in the dabhol power company  would stand to net a hefty amount in damages  the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1  800 crore  which is the total of one years   electricity bill and a termination fee of  300 million  according to an energy analyst  mr pradyumna kaul  the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore  however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2  840 crore  it is learnt that on 20 april  mr deshmukh had given the go  ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc   s board of directors on wednesday  at the meeting  the energy minister  padamsinh patil  energy secretary  mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal  were also present  the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april  however  the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough  given its huge stake in the project  and that such a notice would not be necessary  the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff  with enron   s consent  among those present at the london meeting were mr lal  mr bansal and mseb technical director  mr p paunikar  in their capacity as directors  however  they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party  the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board  it is learnt  the chief minister  mr vilasrao deshmukh  said the state was not in favour of terminating the project  this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm  twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared  the mseb owes enron rs 146  64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001  the centre today put up a brave face on enron   s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country  pti reported from new delhi    there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company  as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector   8 power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc   s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb  emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision  prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs   we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector    in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector   8 mid day  dpc may not wind up  maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor  managing director of the dabhol power corporation  dpc   has been given complete powers with regard to dpc  s operations in the state  including the authority to wind up operations  it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice  mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday  ranganathan said that state officials  including maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal  have reported back to him about the meeting in london  with regard to the state  s failure to pay enron  ranganathan said   bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement  ppa  and dpc owes some money to us  our people informed enron officials about this   in fact  there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice   in the london meeting  mseb and industrial development bank of india  idbi  representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron  promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations  deshmukh added   we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision   deshmukh had earlier said   we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state  as it would be harmful to both of us   enron officials are keeping mum on the issue  mcgregor said   i am not going to give any comment   mid day  april 27  2001 enron offers  no comment  on renegotiation  h s rao a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company  dpc   promoted by the us energy major enron  was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its  900  million power project in maharashtra  but there was no official word on the indian and state governments  decision to renegotiate the contract  an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting  saying the issues discussed at the meeting were  confidential    we have not received any direct communication  unless we get it and evaluate the details  we have no comments to make   the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re  negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  has 15 per cent stake  asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india  the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them  enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company  s stake in dpc  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company  he said the maharashtra government  is not in favour of terminating the 2184  mw project  but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio   mid day  friday  april 27  2001  committee to renegotiate enron deal a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today  addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha  deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow  at the most  he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company   renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee  we don  t want to take any hasty decision   deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably  when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state  9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee  chief minister said it was unfortunate  earlier  in his meeting with hazare  deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people  he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months  afternoon  april 27  2001  enron  s on   state govt  to renegotiate dabhol power project  by hubert vaz the us power giant  enron power corporation  s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise  though the dabhol power company chief  mr  wade cline  has been authorised to do so  since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter  disclosing this  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued  and at the same time enron did not feel slighted   enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision  we are waiting for their letter   he said  when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge  mr  deshmukh said   let our officers come back  after that we will decide a future course of action  but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project  it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron  s decision but as of now the project is still on   when asked whether the project could be moved to another state  if wound up from maharashtra  mr  deshmukh said  that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government  however  it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself  he indicated  he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated  the board of directors of the dabhol power company  which met in london on wednesday  decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project  if he deemed it fit  however  this decision  as of now  does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project  the enron project  which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception  had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time  the previous sena  bjp government  which had been out to terminate the project  however  chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron  s top visiting officials like ms  rebecca mark  and  the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago  meanwhile  state energy minister dr  padamsinh patil  when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house  said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron   it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that  they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides   he said  in case the project is terminated  the government can still manage the power needs of the state  though it would be a bit tough job  he added ,ham

Subject option hedging for ees eugene  bob and i had a discussion about your question you raised yesterday  for an option writer  he has the obligation to deliver  so he hedges it with the underlying by adjesting delta positions  the hedging cost  theoretically  should be equal to the fair value of the option premium  on the other hand  for the option holder  he has no obligation  by delta heging  he would pay double for the option  with no upside  so he should not hedge it at all  if the option holder wants to protect the time value of the option  he should sell the option to the market or some equivalent options to create a theta  neutral portfolio  this may require trading in both the orginal and the equivalent option underlyings  our question to you  if the call options you mentioned are embedded in the ees contracts  say fixed price sale contracts  what makes it possible to just separate those options and sell them to the market to retain the full values of the options  we conjecture that these options are meant to hedge the original contract  by selling those options you eliminate the upside of the original contract  give one of us a call if you want to discuss this further  zimin,ham

Subject california update 5  4  01 if you have any questions  please contact kristin walsh at  713  853  9510  bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance  bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline  any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart  according to sources  both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis  the democratic caucus is reportedly  unwilling to fight  for davis  many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that  once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund  davis would  double dip  into the fund  clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor  however  it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated  a bond issuance will take place  additionally  some generator sources have reported that some of the long  term power contracts  as opposed to those still in development  require that the bond issuance happen by july 1  2001  if not  the state may be in breach of contract  sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th  having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would  eat  the  5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund  thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately  8 billion  however  the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession  sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor  s plan for handling the crisis  including the details and terms of all long  term contracts he has negotiated  before they will support the bond issuance to go forward  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan  ab 8 x and ab 31 x  ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to  10 billion in bonds  this bill passed the senate in march  but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support  ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts  however  sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen  currently in ab 8 x  senator bowen  s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments  which  if passed  would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy   according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature  republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund  for instance  tony strickland has stated that only 1  2 of the bonds  or approximately  5 billion  should be issued  other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds  the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday  additionally  lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan  key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount   4  125 b lenders  jp morgan  2  5 b lehman brothers  1  0 b bear stearns  625 m tax exempt portion  of the  4  125 b   1  6 b is expected to be tax  exempt projected interest rate  taxable rate 5  77  tax  exempt rate 4  77  current projected blended ir  5  38  maturity date  august 29  2001 for more details please contact me at  713  853  9510 bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday  but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday  which authorizes  5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority  the  5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the  5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased  or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward  again  the republicans are not in support of these authorizations  without the details of the long  term power contracts the governor has negotiated  the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support  no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power  also  there is no staff  defined purpose  etc  for the california public power and conservation authority  however  this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates  who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis  socal edison and bankruptcy at this point  two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy  the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor  the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th  however  some decision will likely be made earlier  according to sources  the state has yet to sign the mou with socal  though socal has signed it  the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass  if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou  socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy  or its creditor  involuntary  due to the lack operating cash  the second likely triggering event  which is linked directly to the bond issuance  would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x  bridge loan  stating that the dwr would received 100  of its payments from ratepayers  then the utilities would receive the residual amount  in other words  the state will get paid before the utilities  if this language is included and passed by the legislature  it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy  socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments ,ham

Subject re  stressing correlations hi  everybody  following up on our discussions on stressing correlations i made a spreadsheet and a dll  here is what it does  in the input   main  sheet  the user has to specify   the size of the correlation matrix   the row and column for the element he wants to stress  row  1 and col  3 in the example   the integer number n  iter   the original correlation matrix  in the output  see sheet  results   we see 2 columns   the first column contains possible correlation values  from  1 to 1  n  iter  1 numbers  for the element  1  3    the second column contains the smallest eigenvalue for the  stressed  correlation matrix  which is the same as the original matrix except the elements  1  3  and  3  1  which take values from  1 to 1   thus  the user can see which values for the chosen element  1  3  are permitted  those for which the smallest eigenvalue is positive  marked green in the example   the user might decide that he wants to assign the correlation which is  not permitted  to this particular element  the smallest eigenvalue is negative   then the user might have a few options  1  all the elements of the correlation matrix will be modified so that the chosen element has the desired correlation in it  but the change in the correlation matrix is the  smallest  possible  in the sense of matrix norm   this is my next step to do for this spreadsheet   2  just one column  and the corresponding row  of course  will change  while the rest of the matrix will stay unchanged  kevin  s suggestion   in this case the user have to choose which column  and row  he prefers to modify  in my example  column  row 1 or column  row 3   we can discuss this approach with risk control and see how they like it  i send you only the spreadsheet with an example now  tanya ,ham

Subject precious metals var jason  after our brief discussion last night i think i should discuss a few of the issues i have with respect to calculating a var on the deal that you are proposing  the var model  as i illustrated  is set up to accept a term structure of delta positions  prices and vols and it may be difficult to translate the  silver mine  position into these inputs  i do not think that we can simply take the net silver content of the mine and then make some assumptions about vol and price  the var model also assumes a certain amount of liquidity in the market and a 1 day holding period  to do this properly i would need to understand fully how the deal is priced as these sensitivities are ultimately what will effect the change in mtm in the future and that is essentially what var is supposed to predict  if you need me to work on this then you need to contact steve who will help to prioritise my time  i will also need to consult with vince kaminski and tanya tamarachenko in houston for advice  rac will also assist in the process  please contact me if you have any further questions  kirstee x 34529,ham

Subject energy finance critiques david  here are the reviews of the ut energy finance program that you requested  from jennifer martinez  mba class of 1999  energy finance taken fall of 1998   the energy finance program 2 years ago was very good  especially considering it was the first year of the program  there were a lot of guest speakers from various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge about the energy industry through case studies  lectures  etc  basically  we learned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance classes  but all the cases and examples were energy  related  the professors were good for the most part but didn  t have a great deal of practical industry experience  if i had to guess the reason for decreased participation in the program  i would probably say it is the professors  ronn and titman are great but known as being very technical and quantitative  some students prefer less technical professors and classes that aren  t limiting to the energy industry  also  the fact that the class meets for 3 hours twice a week may not be so appealing  other than those things  i can  t imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment  i especially don  t understand why every single person didn  t drop for enron  i wonder if it has something to do with international status     from john massey  mba class of 1999  energy finance taken fall of 1998   bottom line  ut business schools is great  investment fund  best activity available to students energy finance program  fairly weak  it was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with a weak finance appendage  the finance teacher was pathetic  both a poor teacher  ignorant about industry specific analysis  devoid of industry experience  rude to outside lectures  from industry  keith brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a small portion of the class time  way to make better  get teachers with practical industry experience  make it a seminar class  focus on case studies  lectures  given by people from industry  promote the class within the business school  i felt like ut did a poor job of internally  to students  promoting the class             from ross mesquita  mba class of 1999  energy finance taken fall of 1998   to be honest  a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific  when energy applications were presented  it seemed more like general finance questions were reworded to include energy lingo  we had some very good speakers  but for the most part  i did not feel like the 6 hours of class had enough energy focus  i assumed that this would get better as the program progressed  one reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that energy finance is a very specific focus  i would have probably not enrolled in the energy finance program had it been available in my first year  i did not know enough about energy at that time and i had returned to b  school to consider several career options   i  e   investment banking  corporate finance  entrepreneurship  marketing  etc  as a new mba student  i would not want to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies  here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many mbas   my interest in enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa            from billy braddock  mba class of 1999  energy finance taken fall of 1998   i was a participant in the inaugural energy finance program in the fall of 1998  the primary positives to the class revolved around outside panels  instruction  for example  enron sent representatives on 2 separate occasions to discuss particular topics  vince kaminski and gary hickerson   other notable speakers were jeff sandefer  independent business consultant and e  p professional   the beacon group  and encap investments  another good speaker was a professor from ut  s school of engineering  he brought a good perspective as to the  basics  of the energy business  the class was structured via a team  based instruction approach  with 3 professors team  teaching a 6  hour credit course  none of the 3 professors had any product knowledge of the energy business  of the 3 professors  2 were research focussed  tenured with little credibility in  teaching   one of the professors primary focus of research was fixed income  while the other 2 were investments and corporate finance  respectively  as is the case for ut  s finance program in general  and energy finance in particular  ut is in dire need of teaching professors  as opposed to research professors  that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples and at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a finance background  particular to the energy program  ut needs to have more instruction from energy professionals  such as the instructors used for enron  s internal learning programs  ie  derivatives classes  etc                           from bryan williams  mba class of 1999  energy finance taken fall of 1998   i participated in the first energy finance class offered in fall of 1998  at the university of texas  the curriculum was understandably   rough around the edges  8 as 1998 was the first year the energy finance course was offered  however  the instruction also suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak of  the 6  credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors   two of the three professors have co  authored textbooks  and the third professor   s claim to fame is fixed income  as a group  the three professors are research  heavy  as opposed to industry focused   and the team  teaching format did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for the success of the class  that said  the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside speakers  among them  vince kaminski  gary hickerson  both of enron  they also dedicated one class period to a video conference call with the beacon group  an energy consulting group that i believe was recently acquired by goldman  jeff sandefer  an independent businessman  an entreprenuership instructor  and one of the foremost experts in the e  there are some experienced  brand  name professors  e  g  sheridan titman  teaching in the program  cons   the program should give the students more exposures to energy companies such as enron  specifically  it might need to help students link to the interview oppurtunites from these energy companies such as enron  from george huan  mba class of 2000  energy finance taken fall of 1999   companies expect mba students to have both general management  new ideas  and analytic  quantative  skills  energy industry is no exception  energy finance program offers financial strategy and risk managements courses which fit in the insudtry need  however  these two courses are far from enough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformation and excitements and opportunities in this industry  other management and quantitive courses are needed to complete this program  my suggestions  1  seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies  before students make their decisions  let them know  what  s happening and what  s going to happen in this industry  what the companies are doing now  who they are looking for  2  management and  or analytical courses should be included  such as  strategy  financial enginering and real option  3  more industry connections  presentations and discussions                                  from charlie weldon  mba class of 2000  energy finance taken in fall of 1999  my experience in the energy finance program overall was a positive experience  the most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers brought in during dr  titman  s portion of the class  this part of the course is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of  10 case classes all focusing on the energy industry  two of the cases were based on enron  and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate and well thought out  value added by the professor was less than from the speakers and cases  the first eight weeks of the course covered futures and options  nearly all of the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy industry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the student  s understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market  the use of options and futures for speculating and  or hedging was stressed on numerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power plant project  i believe that the university energy finance faculty are trying to continuously make improvements to the program  however  i do not believe that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to improvement  there is a strong need for more practical based training on energy derivatives similar to the course taught by paradigm here at enron  the focus of the university teachers is quite theoretical  due in large part to their background  while the theoretical basis is crucial to understanding the basics  the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective bridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course  until measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive industry experience  i believe the energy finance program will continue to underdeliver on its objectives  additionally  i believe that the course structure should be changed to eliminate the need of having 3 consecutive hours of classroom instruction ,ham

Subject california on the brink   cera alert cera alert  december 13  2000 title  california on the brink cera knowledge areas  western energy  n  american power  n  american gas california on the brink the california stalemate california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over credit  worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the california market  while numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by california  s utilities  the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation  the current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation  the collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible  western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer  perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis  regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases  the california public utilities commission denied the requests of pacific gas  electric and southern california edison to end their rate freezes  forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy  this has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market  the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry  however  there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole  wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled  in the necessarily political process that will follow  it is possible that  as has largely been the case so far  the steps taken will fail to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws  in the six months since california  s supply shortfall began plaguing western markets  regulators have done little to address the underlying problem  rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage  establishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responses  efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers  indeed  several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions  these include price caps  repeated changes to market rules  attempts to seize generator profits  and a challenging siting and permitting process  medicine worse than the illness several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base  regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall  the void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms  but not the cause  of california  s electric market woes    challenging siting and permitting  despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants  power plant developers still face high hurdles  local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities   price caps discourage investment  state and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market  especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state   repeated rule changes  frequent rule changes in the iso markets  including the price caps  confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development   calls for refunds  despite reports by the power exchange  the iso  and the ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the california markets  state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market  calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development   facility inspections  recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust  cera  s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west are not guaranteed  to make a profit  prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants  decommissioning of older units  demand growth  and numerous other difficult  to  forecast factors  california  s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state  despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special  limited  term capacity payment  cera estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001  in addition  the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the earliest  therefore  three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage  the road to recovery there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall   encourage new build  supply must be part of the answer  this requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build  while in principal some have been taken  such as new fast track approval  the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself  for now  there is still not enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness    stabilize investment climate  utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power  this provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build   move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios  one of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence  and even discouragement  of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the state  particularly for residential and small commercial customers  with the market at a peak  however  now is in one sense a sub  optimal time to move toward term contracting  yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actions  including new supply build and demand side investments  if they end up above market  they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices  a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments   encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response  although originally a feature of california  s market design  most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates  exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response   encourage market mechanisms that dampen the  boom bust  characteristic of the market  whether in the form of a capacity payment  a reserve requirement  or a minimum term portfolio requirement  the california power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment  such a structure can help dampen  but not eliminate  future price volatility   avoid continuously tinkering with the market  while the market does need to be restructured as described above  it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long  term contractual market for power in california  continually tinkering with the market structure  such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since july  only serves to undermine confidence in the market  california needs to do its best to develop a long  term solution and then let the market run its course   allow for greater environmental flexibility  the state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions   free purpa power plants to generate  relief should be granted to purpa power plants that are operational  but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power    end   this cera alert will
