Subject otc gdvi  the momentum continues  gdvi website debute otc bbalert gdvi news update  global diversified industries debutes brand new website  www  gdvi  net otc bb alert spectacular operating results momentum continues sales projections for next 12 months surpasses  20 million 99  8  revenue increase 278  net income increase 154  stockholders equity increase 79  increase in assets  8 million order backlog  50 million manufacturing capacity overview global diversified industries operates in the modular building construction industry  and strategically targets the california education sector  gdvi is strategically located in central california on 16 acres with a 100  000 square foot state  of  the  art manufacturing facility  throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions  development of a state  of  the  art manufacturing facility  and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth  through the combination of its new facility   50 million capacity   the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california  s bond approvals  gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast  gdvi should benefit greatly from the  12  1 billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month  march   this presents  in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies  global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout 2003 and 2004  including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in 2005  the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into  50 million per annum businesses  in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue projections  renewed its piggyback contract  received state approvals on engineered product designs  started a new credit facility and opened its new 100  000 square foot manufacturing facility  the company will continue to seek new acquisition candidates through its aggressive growth plan  profile gdvi is a holding company that currently operates two wholly owned subsidiaries  mbs construction inc   a modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and global modular  inc   a sales  marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures  its principal customer base is currently educational  public and private schools  universities  etc    child  care and municipality sectors  its product lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs  including both single  story and two  story floor plans  global modular  s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre  approved building plans  commonly referred to as p  c   s or pre  checked plans  that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects  dsa   global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause  the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district  this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids  a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years  depending on the term of the piggyback contract  the strategic focus on california schools since 1998  california legislation has required that at least 20  of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures  there are five compelling reasons for this trend  modular classrooms are faster to construct  as quickly as 2 weeks  they cost significantly less  as low as  30  000 vs   100  000  they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth  the state department of education estimates that california will need more than 2  500 classrooms each year for the next four years  which equates to more than 10  000 classrooms  due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector  public and private schools are expected to turn to portable  modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years  the california schools budget crisis on november 5  2002 a  13  2 billion school facilities improvements bond proposal  proposition 47  was passed by california voters  this bond measure passage does not include an approximate  9  4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state  a second bond measure worth  12  1 billion went before the voters on the march 2004  these bond measures are about three times higher than the record  9  2 billion bond california voters approved in 1998  the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs  which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations  money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools  design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other institutions of higher learning throughout california  gdvi business infrastructure among global modular  s asset base is its integrated  state  of  the  art  automated manufacturing process which

Subject var david  during today  s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations  mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system  we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory  also  in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it  s difficult to model the price curves independently  we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves  we have agreed on the following  1  winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic  core  curves  he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run  2  the curves associated with the biggest 10  20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves  i  e  no mapping into other locations   it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates  3  the results of an automated clustering  mapping  procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions  this responsibility should be vested with one person  right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible   research can allocate one person to this task  cooperation of trading and rac will be critical  vince,ham

requirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives  a vote against the exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility  and raises other important concerns for energy suppliers   attached is a summary of this issue   the board is expected to vote on this issue during may 2001  eei will be taking steps to appraise fasb of our concerns  if you  or company cfo would like more information about this effort  please contact richard mcmahon  executive director of the alliance of energy suppliers  at rmcmahon  eei  org  or at 202  508  5571  alliance of energy suppliers express   april 25  2001 inside washington federal affairs    bill repealing puhca is approved by senate committee    the senate banking committee today approved s 206  a bill that repeals the public utility holding company act of 1935  the bill would repeal puhca and transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the securities and exchange commission to the federal energy regulatory commission and appropriate state agencies  s  206 was approved with two amendments  offered by sen  mike enzi  r  wy   the first amendment would establish the electric energy market competition task force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for electric energy in the united states  the task force would be made up of representatives of ferc  the department of justice and the federal trade commission  as well as non  voting representatives from the department of agriculture and the securities and exchange commission  the amendment also contained a provision  co  sponsored by sen  paul sarbanes  d  md   that would preserve ferc  s authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do not include the pass  through of holding company costs that are unrelated to energy  another amendment  offered by sen  jon corzine  d  nj   initiated a study by the general accounting office of the success of federal and state governments in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets     institute   s tax agreement with public power again introduced on hill    the tax agreement eei reached with the american public power association  appa  and the large public power council  lppc  again has been introduced in the house  the bill  hr 1459  contains the same provisions as were in a measure  hr 4971   with technical corrections  introduced during the 106 th congress  hr 1459 was introduced by rep  j  d  hayworth  r  az  and nine original co  sponsors from the ways and means committee  hr 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes  1  the tax  free sale or spin  off of transmission assets into an rto is allowed  2  nuclear decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost  of service ratemaking  3  the contributions in aid of construction  ciac  tax on interconnections to transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated  and 4  private use tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution facilities  the measure was referred to the house ways and means committee  and eei has urged congress to act without delay in moving it forward  enactment will help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment  the institute noted  the same legislation has been incorporated into s 389  senate energy committee chairman frank murkowski  s  r  ak  energy security bill  and stand  alone legislation could also be introduced  hearings are expected to be held in both the senate finance and house ways and means committees  probably after consideration of president bush  s individual tax proposal  administration  ferc    white house seeks  2 trillion budget in fiscal year 2002    president bush last week transmitted a  2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget request to capitol hill  the administration noted that its proposal  moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent in 2002   an increase of  26 billion over the preceding fiscal year  the budget bid contains a  231 billion total surplus in 2002  and projects a  5  6 trillion surplus over the next ten years  in the energy area  the administration noted the federal government   s  longstanding and evolving role  in the sector  pointing out that most federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts  it proposed about  2  8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs  and about  2  1 billion in tax benefits   mainly to encourage development of traditional and alternative energy sources   doe   s budget request was  19  2 billion  including  2  3 billion for energy resources programs  this later figure represents a decrease of  196 million  or 7  9 percent  from fiscal year 2001  in the environmental sector  the administration sought some  7  3 billion in discretionary funding for epa  including a  3  7 billion operating program focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws     success of restructuring tied to energy strategy  ferc   s massey asserts    electric restructuring may be in jeopardy  and its success  is in the hands of regulators and policymakers   ferc commissioner william massey has asserted  speaking at a recent national governors association policy forum in philadelphia  commissioner massey urged officials to pay attention to the key elements of a national energy strategy  first  he specified  there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy commodity  turning to a second element  commissioner massey told forum attendees that  all the supply in the world won   t help unless it can be delivered over an adequate  efficient  non  discriminatory network   commissioner massey identified market structure as the third essential element of a national energy strategy  while citing an inherent difficulty  that  good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail jurisdictions   accordingly  he said  ferc and the states must work together on market structure  the final element of a successful energy strategy  the commissioner specified  is the need for aggressive ferc intervention when markets fail to do their job   if the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator to ensure reasonable prices for consumers   he cautioned  they  will surely think twice before heading down the restructuring path   new generation    dynegy to build second plant in kentucky

Subject vince  liberty gas storage project  we appreciated the insight from zimin lu on the liberty gas storage project  i had originally thought that enron could negotiate a deal directly with hng storage co  on the joint development of these facilities  however  hngs has now retained wasserstein pirella to  market  the opportunity   fyi  wasserstein was the investment banker that handled the recent sale of the market hub partners storage facilities  so they certainly would have a current list of interested parties   unfortuneately  we will now have to participate in another  auction  if we are to pursue this further  i  ll let you know what we decide to do  alaska  northern canada pipeline  i would like to discuss ways that enron might enhance our prospect of participating in the initiative to bring substantial new gas reserves from alaska and northern canada to the lower 48  a large equity investment in a very expensive  regulated pipeline is not likely to get much support within enron  instead  our competitive advantage may best be realized through the efficient and creative utilization of the existing us pipeline grid    backhaul  on northern natural  expansion opportunities on northern border and nng  or even capacity exchanges with other pipeline operators   i think it would be very useful if we had the capability to model the impact of the evolving north american marketplace on that initiative  and vice versa  any insight we could develop on who will be the eventual  winners  and  losers  if  when that large volume of new gas enters the market would be valuable  i will look forward to our discussion tomorrow  thursday  at 1  30 pm  regards  jng,ham

Subject el paso statement on california situation in case you haven  t already seen this  el paso addresses the california energy situation  february 26  2001  houston  feb  26  prnewswire    el paso corporation  nyse  epg  reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties involved to help improve california  s energy situation   we are surprised to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning el paso  s involvement in california   said norma dunn  senior vice president of corporate communications and external affairs at el paso corporation   we would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record   the significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power  which has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate electricity  high natural gas prices are  therefore  an effect rather than a cause of the power shortage  allegations that natural gas prices were deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue  it is not possible for any holder of capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline to cause a significant increase in california gas prices by refusing to use that capacity  the el paso natural gas pipeline is required by law to post the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate found to be just and reasonable by the federal energy regulatory commission  all capacity held by el paso merchant energy on the el paso natural gas pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to serve california and other western markets  allegations that there was a  conspiracy  in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into california are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge  the facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990 s were either built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer support to justify their construction  for example  despite years of marketing efforts by tenneco  not a single potential customer could be induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed altamont project to proceed  for that reason alone  it was ultimately dropped  in 1996  according to estimates  there were between one and two billion cubic feet per day  bcf  d  of excess natural gas transportation capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving california  indeed  it was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess capacity that prompted the california public utilities commission to encourage pg  e  socal edison  and socal gas  beginning in 1996 and continuing into 1998  to relinquish over 1  5 bcf  d of firm transportation capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline  processes are now under way to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity into california  and el paso intends to do its part to help satisfy whatever needs may be established today  as recently as last year  there were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available on the el paso natural gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands at that time  notwithstanding its availability  this capacity was not used by shippers to california to fill in  state natural gas storage facilities for future use  if california had taken advantage of the opportunity in 2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999  reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in prices at the california border could have been substantially mitigated or avoided  it is now widely recognized that the california  energy crisis  was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in california to keep pace with the state  s economy and increased demand  a combination of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices  first  the construction of new power plants in california is a slow  difficult  and heavily regulated process  as a result  the growing demand has far outstripped in  state generating capabilities  second  unfavorable precipitation and increased out  of  state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power normally relied on by california to become unavailable  third  increased demand for power in the western united states drove up prices that california had to pay to out  of  state generators  fourth  state policies deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers  leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their costs  fifth  because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased costs to consumers  the utilities  creditworthiness was impaired  causing supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and expensive to purchase  sixth  the early and greater  than  normal use of peaking units  plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand conditions  necessitated unscheduled maintenance  rendering them unavailable at critical times  seventh  during the final months of 2000  some power plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air emissions credits  eighth  a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold weather further drove up demand for power  finally  the increased power costs in california could have been substantially mitigated through long  term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short  term power market   california is currently in a difficult position  but now has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long  term energy policy   said dunn   el paso has been one of the largest suppliers of energy to california for more than 50 years  and we are actively participating with all parties in california to be a part of a long  term  stable solution to california  s energy needs   el paso corporation  the largest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world  spans the energy value chain from wellhead to electron  with an enterprise value in excess of  50 billion  el paso is a leader in every phase of the natural gas industry  the company owns and operates a significant portion of the north american natural gas delivery grid  operates the fastest growing  most sophisticated energy merchant group  and is the nation  s third largest natural gas producer  el

 thursday jan 18 2001 the government of maharashtra wants new delhi to convince the power trading corporation  a central utility  to buy power from dabhol and sell it across the country  it would be far simpler if dabhol and all independent power producers were allowed to sell power to whoever was willing to pay for it  that  unfortunately  is not allowed by law  which forces private sector generators to sell power only to state utilities  which in turn  are not permitted to sell power across states on their own  most state electricity boards are bankrupt  mseb reportedly owes central utilities rs 5  000 crore  they cannot bring themselves to charge many types of users for the power consumed  nor can they prevent large  scale theft of electricity  few  including wealthy maharashtra  have the will to reform state electricity boards and privatise transmission and distribution  given this profile of buyers  private generators demand sovereign guarantees to help them tide over default risks  but the guarantees merely insulate ipps against risk  they cannot make sebs solvent  yet  india needs power desperately  maharashtra  india   s richest state  experiences power shortages of around 2  000 mw  about a sixth of its peak needs  over time  the hunger for power will only grow  india cannot afford to wait for the painful politics of seb reform to work themselves out  the government should bring in legislation that allows ipps to sell power directly to paying customers  this will free ipps from the clutches of bankrupt monopsony buyers  the power trading legislation will have unexpectedly happy consequences for the government too  once ipps are freed from their onerous obligations to sell power to single  mostly bankrupt buyers  their default risks will come down substantially  new delhi and state governments should then scrap the guarantees that they gave ipps in the past  the combination of power trading  private investments in generation  transmission and distribution  and gradual seb reform will create a commercial  workable and competitive power market in india  anything less will be a recipe for disaster         state not to give tax sops to dpc for buying naphtha from ioc   sanjay jog  thursday jan 18 2001 the maharshtra government  s finance department  which is striving to reduce fiscal deficit from rs 9  484 crore to rs 3  484 crore by the beginning of april this year  has expressed its inability to provide a sales tax waiver to the dabhol power company  dpc  on the procurement of 1  2 million tonne of naphtha from the state  run indian oil corporation  ioc   mantralaya sources told the financial express on wednesday that dpc would have to pay 4 per cent sales tax   the government  way back in 1995  has modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of naphtha from gujarat by electrical companies operating in maharashtra  the decision was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphtha at reduced rates within the state   government sources added  sources said that these companies had to pay nearly 15  3 per cent sales tax on naphtha that was procured from gujarat  however  following their representation  the government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent  the state finance department  s opinion  which would be presented before the state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision  deserves special significance especially when the state energy department and the loss  making maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  have wholeheartedly supported the dpc  s cause and recommended the sales tax waiver  dpc  which was asked by the union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in view of excess availability  in its presentation to the state government and to mseb  had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to pass on the additional burden on the mseb which would be ultimately passed on to its consumers  dpc had also told the state government that it had not paid sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from glencore in the calender year 2000  sources from the state energy department and mseb have stressed on the need for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden  they have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales tax exemption to dpc because the ioc  at the behest of the centre  has tried to match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed memorandum of agreement with dpc   if the state finance department sticks to its views  it may hurt the state as a whole   sources from the state energy department and mseb said  dpc will procure naphtha at rs 11  050 per ton from ioc during the calender year 2001 as compared to the rs 10  050 per tonne price quoted by glencore  the naphtha price comprises  175 per tonne free on board  fob   21  8 per cent of customs duty  5  4 per cent of sales tax and  18  87 of premium  dpc senior vice president mukesh tyagi reiterated that the company has already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers   sales tax is a pass through and mseb  which will have to bear the additional burden  will pass it on the consumers   he added         centre yet to receive proposal on enron thursday jan 18 2001 centre on wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the enron promoted dhabol power project relating to cost and surplus power  asked about the reports that maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre buy surplus power from dhabol power company through power trading corporation  power minister suresh prabhu said  we have not received any proposal    we are carefully watching the situation and will await a concrete proposal before intervening in this matter   parbhu said on the sidelines of greentech environment excellence awards ceremony  here  asked whether there was any possibility of the government asking the power trading corporation to buy power from the dhabol power corporation  prabhu replied  what will the ptc do with the power   prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before approaching the centre for payment of dues  mseb had earlier declined to pick up its 15 per cent stake in phase ii of the 1444 mw project  the enron issue has been hanging fire with the maharashtra state electricity board unable to clear the dues of dpc as a result of the skyrocketing prices of naphtha infact mseb has asked dpc to backdown completely leading to a situation where dpc has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the month

Subject adaptive trade vince  zimin  i participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning  there was a possibility enron would invest in it  their product appears to be a gui interface over the top of ilog solver  and possibly ilog cplex  which allows problems to be expressed in high level terms  i do not see any immediate application at enron  but i am interested in the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo  maybe it would be useful for general modelling projects here  they do not even have a user manual for their software  so it will be difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged  the possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ilog software is a modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that market  i think the scheduling tools in sap  i 2  etc are more likely to succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information system  because of the small market for this software  the many competitors  the absence of any clear use for it at enron and the early stage of development  there is very little prospect of us funding this company  tom,ham

Subject fw  london work hi  how are you  london seems to be the same as when i left in august  no sun  cold  serious looking people  expensive  etc  in addition  we have had may day riots  a post office bombing  train strike  etc  not to mention all the excitement in enron credit  it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to  i am getting loads of conflicting messages  as illustrated in the forwarded email from vasant  according to you and slava  the strategy paper  duffie report seems to be a higher priority  however  vasant seems to indicate  in his forwarded email  that this is not the priority at the moment  in addition  there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit  not only in the houston office  but even more so in the london office  this brings to mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on the current state of enron credit   a fish rots from the head   finally  i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this duffie report  do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear  that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting  infrastructure   or do you want to hear what i really see  hear  read  etc   if the latter is true  then i may need to write two reports  because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the enron credit personnel too happy  well  i think i have said enough for now  look forward to your feedback  thanks  iris      original message      from  shanbhogue  vasant sent  friday  may 04  2001 3  39 pm to  mack  iris cc  dhar  amitava subject  london work hi iris  amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work here  as a result  we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied  you should also make sure to understand the econometric  data analysis software side of the project   this is probably more important than preparing a document for duffie right now  you should definitely sit with ben  george and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used  but we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data  both amitava and i will help as best as we can  and answer any direct questions  but we will have limited time to review documents  etc  i expect amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming  but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data  hope the trip is going well  would you be extending the trip for some more time  vasant,ham

Subject re  sharad update hi kate  firstly it was very useful to hold the informal discussion with him  sharad seemed hesitant due to the offer not being what he expected  he asked me some questions about the  bonus culture  at enron and suggested that it was not as good as at investment banks that he is interviewing with  i sold him on the value he can extract from the excellence within the research group and the ability to join a growing organisation at a critical point in  but he still seemed reticent saying that he  needs time  which i understood to mean that he was looking for a better offer elsewhere  he is a great candidate and it would be a real shame to lose him  given the difficulty of getting good candidates  i discussed this with vince and given how much we need him in research in london and vince agreed to discuss the possibility of an element of guarantee or sign on to help him make the right decision  i think vince will call you or dale to discuss this  regards  anjam tel  713 345 9991  p  s  vince  kate bruges is on extension 37354  dale is on 36726  kate bruges 13  07  2000 11  02 to  anjam ahmad  lon  ect  ect cc  subject  sharad hi anjam how did your conversation go yesterday  regards kate,ham

Subject sr  director position vince  as you requested  i have obtained some information from norma relating to the salary parameters of the sr  director position  the minimum salary is  83  800  and the maximum is  168  000  huge range  isn  t it    however  norma did ask me to bring a couple of things to your attention  the lowest salary of a vp in your group is currently  140  000  and the average director  s salary in your group is  120  000  those numbers narrow the range considerably  of course  there is no equity issue since there is no other senior director in your group  hope this information helps  molly,ham

Subject california update 4  27  01 the following report contains confidential and sensitive information  please treat with discretion  executive summary   ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives  politically  bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis  from an economic perspective  he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation  davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan  most notably its exclusion of out  of  state generators  june lst  kill clause  for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan  california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade  expected  20 billion power bill this summer   economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement  qf bid for advance payments from pg  e likely to fail in bankruptcy court  new generation delays probable because of state  qf squabbling  consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal 1  ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action  but is not  rather  it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated  the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame  once they are politically inoculated  the administration can begin to look at regional solutions  moreover  the administration has already made explicit  and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report  its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation  it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan  2  something less than effective price caps from davis  s point of view  the ferc plan has four major flaws   the order applies only to california  not to the rest of the west  non  california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california   as the order is written  it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling   state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system  because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion   even when the price caps kick in  they are based on the cost  plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap  the generators can also charge above the cap  provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc  3  proposal  kill clause  adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a  kill clause  that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california  s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control  if davis doesn  t sign on to the regional grid by june lst  then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the  bush price caps plan  collapse  4  growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as  20 billion on power this summer  this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg  e and sce  these sources believe that  because of the severity of the situation  the ferc and  or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power  the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days  one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long  term power deals  the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california  the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture  the country  s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months  5  qfs to seek advance payment from pg  e meanwhile  on the bankruptcy front  the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge  s accounts  since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas  it appears very unlikely that the qfs  request will be granted  if the qfs do not receive advance payment  it is likely that most of the 4  000 mw of gas  fired qf capacity will remain offline  6 delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for long  term contracts are being continually renegotiated  which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated  7  consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan  the analysis was done by a utilities analyst  rather than a lawyer  though it appears to raise a number of good legal points  for example  one of the elements of the mou is a  non  bypassable  charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid  this is effectively a tax  since there is no exchange of value for money  which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity  this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds  rather than revenue bonds  according to the constitution  the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company  for this and other reasons  even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout  which remains unlikely  the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge  8  governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long  term power contracts the issue of the governor  s failure to disclose the details of the long  term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis  even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating  it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged  creating an even further delay ,ham

Subject capital hill gold  chgi  potential high grade gold deposit breaking news  denver  june 14  2005  business wire    capital hill gold  inc   chgi  reports that the company  s geologists are evaluating a potential high  grade bulk  tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county  nevada  the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past  producing gold mines  including the paradise peak  santa fe and rawhide deposits  after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area  geologists believe that the target would be a high  grade bulk  tonnage gold deposit  virgin deposits  the privately  held 440  acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the 1990 s  the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated  follow  up work by the company  s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately 200 unpatented lode  mining claims in the area during 2001 and 2002  geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances  samples were collected from several outcrops on the property  and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko  nevada for assaying  based on positive assay results  target and identification  a major claim  staking program will be launched accordingly  as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit  and the first results coming in are showing promise  on june 13  2005 the company announced in a press release that capital hill  s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u 3 o 8  uranium oxide  assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company  s uranium project has returned assays grading 0  061  u 3 o 8 to 0  068  u 3 o 8 of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals  with results ranging from 0  08 to 0  22 oz ag  st and trace amounts of gold  the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation  the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend  rallying from 5 cents to 75 cents during the past three months  as the three  month chart illustrates  trading volume has swelled to 300  000 shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows  which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation  the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company  s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields  the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled  but as mentioned above  early tests are very promising  which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data  capital hill gold  s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world  class ore deposits  chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property  s potential and the financial capabilities of the company  in recent weeks  chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore  in addition  the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities  since 2003 uranium prices have doubled  20  of the world  s electricity comes from uranium  and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing  the united states needs to add about 100 nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix  nils j  diaz  chairman of the u  s  nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may 2005  as of may 17  2005 the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site  and have begun staking claims  the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial  grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work  including geophysical surveys  reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in  place resources at one of the past  producing uranium mines in the project area  a chinese news web site reports that china  the world  s second  largest energy consumer after the u  s   will spend 400 billion yuan  u  s   48  33 billion  on building new nuclear power plants by 2020  this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past  the energy  hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current 16 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts within 15 years  nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach 60 gigawatts by that time  so the market for uranium is in a new bull market  conclusion development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better  than  expected geophysical testing results  shares of chgi have rallied over 10  fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium  once full mining operations are under way  it is our view  that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream  for additional information  visit investor relations solutions is

bytes mix reshaping energy market  purchase of mg  only a  start in  building b 2 b platforms  writes hillary durgin       companies financial times  16  jun  2000 12  00  00 am   604  words  by hillary durgin   if jeffrey skilling is right    enron  s acquisition of mg is only the tip of the  iceberg   enron  s president and  chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental  strategy shift at the  houston energy company  aimed at making it a dominant   new  economy   player across various industrial markets    the dollars 446 m acquisition last month of mg  the  uk  based  metals trader   is only the first of more than dollars lbn in  estimated new  investments the  company is targeting  it is seeking vehicles on which  to  build  business  to  business  b 2 b  platforms in sectors such  as  logistics  chemicals   agricultural products and pulp  paper    mr skilling wants to take the business model the  company  developed in  natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale  commodity markets  he  argues the electronic platforms it creates will not  only  become the principal  b 2 b sites for those sectors  but reshape those  industries    as an example  he points to enron  s new e  commerce  platform   enrononline   which has changed the way the company does business  with its  customers  while significantly increasing sales    the company  the largest wholesale merchant of  natural gas  and power  saw  wholesale  physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53  per  cent in the first  quarter    critics argue that enron  s move away from its familiar  energy business into  new industries  where the learning curve is steep and  the  competition  entrenched  is risky  yet a number of industry  analysts  point out enron has  proved it understands markets and how to manage risks  while  becoming the  largest importer of coal in the uk  the largest trader  of  gas and power in the  us and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth     it  s a prudent strategy  but it  s got to be done in  an  orderly way   says ronald  barone  analyst with paine  webber in new york   what  they  re  doing here is  what they  ve been incredibly successful at doing   he  adds   noting that enron  posted dollars 1  3 bn in earnings before interest and  taxes   ebit  from its  wholesale energy and services business in 1999  up 34  per  cent from the  previous year    earnings from that division accounted for two  thirds  of the  company  s overall  income before interest and taxes last year  and mr  barone  sees the unit  s ebit  increasing 15  30 per cent annually over several years    as with gas and power and now broadband  where enron  is  standardising  contracts and creating a market in bandwidth  it wants  to  create markets by  entering as a

Subject wall street  s dirty little secret    it was the spring of 1979  i was just a tall  goofy looking kid in middle school with buck  teeth and freckles  each day in the cafeteria  i walked from table to table    stealing other kids  lunch money  no  i didn  t rob them with a gun or a knife  i just made them a little deal   let me borrow two dollars today   i said   and i  ll bring you five dollars next week   the investment was too good to pass up  and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes  of course when  next week  rolled around and i couldn  t pony up the cash  i promised to pay them even more the week after that  if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer  eventually the end of the year came and went  high school started and with it came girls  and homework  and parties  and sports  and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year  s lunch money  i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid  and i didn  t even get beat up  hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn  first of all  greed is your number one enemy  you  re not going to turn  2 into  5 in a week  so cash out when you  re ahead  don  t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket  second  never trust an investment adviser of any kind  they are looking out for their own money  not yours  the  professionals   those stuffy investment counselors and money managers  will always tell you that the best time to buy is now  according to those guys  the longer you keep your money in the market  the more money you  re going to make  ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is  never   in a sense  they are right  if you put  250  000 in an index fund right now  you  ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years  but here  s the problem  do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich  hell no  you want the money now  so you can enjoy it  it  s hard to make use of your fortune when you  re seventy years old in a wheelchair  if you could make a million dollars in the next few years  what would you do with it  where would you travel  what kind of car would you buy  the fact is    youth is the best time to be rich  if your goal is to make quick profits in the market  volatility is your ally  and stability your enemy  you want to see those large upswings  two hundred points in a day  followed by the four hundred point crash a week later  you don  t care if the market went up or down 20  this year as long it was unstable  that  s how you  re going to make the money  what i  m talking about here is day trading  my father invests the traditional way  he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k  in the long term of 5  10 years he makes money  the day trader buys or sells 5  000 shares of xyz for a  25  000 profit in a 5  10 minute trade  he acts quickly  taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock  and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours  sometimes within minutes  i can teach you how to do this  and how to make amazing amounts of money at it  it  s not rocket science  and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started  society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training  the truth is  wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money  popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring  they don  t want the competetion  and they sure as hell don  t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they  d charge you forty or fifty dollars  they make their money only if you believe two lies  1  that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person  2  that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade  here is what the financial gurus in today  s society absolutely  positively do not want you to know    the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it  provided they spend a few hours of studying  after reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade  and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market  i  ve learned the following lessons    achieving financial success is incredibly simple    anyone can do it    it only takes a few hours to learn  when i discovered the secret to day trading  i didn  t become wealthy overnight  if you want instant cash  drive to wal  mart  buy a ski mask and a shotgun  and rob your local bank  the only way to get rich  quick or otherwise  is through hard work  knowledge  and determination  after learning the fundamentals of day trading  i started practicing the trading art itself  and the first few weeks brought modest gains  the next few months gave me the practical experience i needed to really earn a living  and i was pulling close to a six figure income  in less than three years with no formal financial training  minimal effort and only moderate risk  i had made my first million  the knowledge that i gained during those formative trading years i am willing to share with you in my new book  the master trader  you will learn from my mistakes  and from my successes  as i teach you the simple  secret formula for day trading that i  ve used profitably year after year  the income of the day trader can be staggering  thousands  even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes  the difference between making money and

of  500  000 per year 22  average an income in excess of  250  000 per year 35  average an income in excess of  100  000 per year  27  average an income between  50  000 and  99  999 per year 11

Subject comments hi sheridan  how are you  i hope that you had a good vacation  vasant and i looked at your memo and found it to be interesting  i shall first briefly summarize our understanding of the methodology you propose  the comments follow  finally  i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case in further refining the model  it appears that you are proposing a state  space approach where probabilities of different states at various future dates are specified  the next step is to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the branches from the origin to one of the terminal points  traversing through the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the average present value of the project  also  you are using the simulation to assign a value of the project to each node  thus each node will have a cash flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward  if some of these values turn out to be negative  zero  coupon  risk  free bonds are purchased to neutralize the negative realization  next  we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our project  based on the variance of the returns   we iterate until convergence  finally  we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital from the pv of the gross cash flows  including debt  to determine if the project merits further consideration  comments  clarifications 1  the money is being set aside to avoid negative values  it is not clear if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node  anyhow  we shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at that cross  section of time as the risk  free asset pays in all states of nature  this will have to be done every time there is a negative realization  thus  for the typical project we have  the value of risk capital may be extremely high  as we are not following a tail  based norm anymore  2  your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all values being positive  if so  we are only issuing risk  free debt  also  a project with a single negative value at each cross  section of time will not have a positive debt capacity  3  it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate  which is obtained in each step from the comparison investment  by equating the variances   it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence  also  our project has a finite life and the market  based assets will have infinite lives  in the light of this fact  how will we define the relevant variance  is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment  4  finally  our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment and also the risk capital  setting risk capital to zero  this model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines the discount rate  gas field case to facilitate your thinking  we are providing a gas field example below  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field  a profile of expected production and variance of the production per year is available from the engineers at the beginning  production will be autocorrelated  as the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or less than the estimated reserves  we assume the life of the field to be 10 years with no salvage value  there are fixed and variable operating costs  it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this problem  do let me know if you have further questions  rakesh,ham

Subject request from  mr joe mark email fax  1 561 619 2791 email  mrjoemark  yahoo  com dear sir request for urgent business relationship strictly confidential  firstly  i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction  this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret  though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried  but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day  we have decided to contact you first by your email due to the urgency of this transaction  as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you  so we decided it is best using the email  let me start by first introducing myself properly to you  i am dr  kaku opa  a director general in the ministry of mines and power and i head a three  man tender board appointed by the government of the federal republic of nigeria to award contracts to individuals and companies and to approve such contract payments in the ministry of mines and power  the duties of the committee also include evaluation  vetting and monitoring of work done by foreign and local contractors in the ministry  i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence  in order to commence this business  we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds  the source of this funds is as follows  between 1996 and 1997  this committee awarded contracts to various contractors for engineering  procurement  supply of electrical equipments such as transformers  and some rural electrification projects  however  these contracts were over  invoiced by the committee  thereby  leaving the sum of us  11  5 million dollars  eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars  in excess  this was done with the intention that the committee will share the excess when the payments are approved  the federal government have since approved the total contract sum which has been paid out to the companies and contractors concerned which executed the contracts  leaving the balance of  11  5 m dollars  which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe off  shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst ourselves  we need your assistance as the funds are presently secured in an escrow account of the federal government specifically set aside for the settlement of outstanding payments to foreign contractors  we are handicapped in the circumstances as the civil service code of conduct  does not allow us to operate off  shore accounts  hence your importance in the whole transaction  my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf  you or your company will retain 20  of the total amount of us  11  500  000  00  eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars   while 70  will be for us  members of this panel  and the remaining 10  will be used in offsetting all debts  expenses incurred  both local and foreign  in the cause of this transfer  needless to say  the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous  in return we demand your complete honesty and trust  it does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here  the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub  contracted it out to other companies  more often

 the example copies attached include the following special features  99 feb  analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean 99 sep  patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere 99 dec  analysis of the resid market in chile these type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects related to fuel oil  i have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the

any money to anyone else in ene  then i have to question its validity and utility to me as well  doug  would this perhaps be useful to any other business units that have exposure to fo prices  best

Subject re  ebs var transaction policy i have two things biting me  first is time  i need to turn a draft for hannon and rice asap  so  the value of a deliberative approach to coming up with a v  r policy will quickly evaporate if we take 2 weeks to study what the policy should say  second  i have a unique situation  our concept of v  r is really unlike the rest of enron  s today  what happens today is that network engineers unilaterally make decisions about deployment  configuration and other matters which effect the longs and shorts of our asset  contract portfolio that they view strictly from a network operating standpoint  a good example was a decision to move our primary terapop  three large servers storing 165 gigabytes each  from portland to la  the servers are already in place and purchased  so no capital was involved  but the decision has huge ramifications on the future la  new york and other bandwidth usage  and that cost money  now it could be that the la  new york cost is cheaper than the portland  new york cost  the whole point is no one knows  what our  value  at  risk  policy attempt to corral is these types of decisions and put them into the hands of the risk management group  where the decision will be made with at least some economic work behind it  i really see the ebs v  r policy to be misnamed  since we don  t really have the math done to calc v  r  it really is a volumetric  based control policy that says you can  t make network changes over xx amount of megabytes  a storage measure  or oc  3 equivalents  a bandwidth measure  without risk management making or approving the decision  i do believe that with research  s help  we can in time actually calculate the v  r impact of such decisions  at that time  the policy should be modified to set metrics based on the v  r calculations  so if you have an open enough mind to let us co  op your word for a minute  we need to start turning the minds of the network industry people into

attempted to do so through the enron corp transaction approval process  tap   i have forwarded to john a copy of this  along with the risk management policy  i  ll let him share with you if ok  i really don  t want to act as the firm  s in  house kinko  s     we have taken the first step and done poorly on follow  up steps to create a very easy to follow process for anything other than direct funded capital  however  some process around a greater number of assets  deals is better than none  i agree that i have not seen a really good fully baked one implemented  but i think it is wrong not to try  the only concerns i have is that  given that we want to have  standard  metrics and approval processes around the firm  ebs creates a process  metric which is complementary to and integrates with processes  metrics that the other business units are subjected to  ted barry pearce  enron communications 06  29  2000 09  09 am to  stinson gibner  hou  ect  ect  dale surbey  lon  ect  ect  ted

subject  ebs var transaction policy hey you guys  we are trying to implement a  var transaction  policy  and would like your opinion  this is going to be tough  because i  m not sure we have implemented a similiar policy across any of our other  books   that is  we looking to bring in all the accrual  operational assets as well as the mtm stuff  lambdas   to have a real  live  configuration  of the system  if assets  routes  servers etc    are added  what is the impact on the  value  of the system and what it  s worth  john has attached a draft below  for your review and thoughts  i can see how this works in a trading environment  when you actually know the var of your whole trading portfolio  however  i  ve not seen this done with a mixture of mtm  accrual assets  add the spice of a  operational system  valuation  and this will be tough to quantify and model  step 1  configure system and value it step 2  calculate a var on this  we will need to do some work here  step 3  calculate the incremental var of new deals  amendements  reconfigs etc  tough     see what you think  b  john echols 06  28  00 05  41 pm to  jim fallon  enron communications  enron communications  barry pearce  enron communications  enron communications  lou casari  enron communications  enron communications cc  subject  policies here is a first rough draft of a  value  risk  transaction policy  i would like you to start looking at where we are going on the policy and get some early thinking going on limits for the v  r  for example  should we effectively shut down all server relocations without approval  or allow some level of mb of storage to be moved around or reconfigured  i need some commercial and industry realism for this  we may need rick paiste or your industry helpers  marquardt  etc  to help us   barry  lou  i need your input ,ham

Subject new update on ppi model for inflation book  final version dear all  attached is anjam  s reasoning and final version of the uk ppi pllu model  the uk inflation book  s main exposure is to two ppi indexes  the pllu and the dzcv through year 2010  both are ppi output indexes with very comparable baskets  the only significant difference between the two is the presence of energy in the pllu  7  6    the model in use escalates the two indexes by the same factors  however  with the energy price fluctuations in recent years different models for the two indexes would reflect better the nature of their drivers  anjam concentrated on the pllu index first and he will shortly construct one for the dzcv based on the same methodology  but without the brent crude curve  the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve  it is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one  and it is considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients  this will result in us having more confidence in our monthly p  l as well as less fluctuations  best regards  martina x 34327 anjam ahmad 10  03  2000 11  59 to  martina angelova  lon  ect  ect cc  subject  new update on ppi model for inflation book dear all  i followed up on the suggestions of happening babe at the conference call as follows   1  use less data unfortunately  kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less robust  in fact dramatically so  and so eliminates the possibility of using less data  the model tested was the rpi  month  15  ppi pre  empts the moves in rpi by about 8 months  the magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced  this shows that if we had more detail in our rpi forward curve  then the ppi model would reflect those peaks and humps adequately  conclusion i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi  rpi  t  15  and deviations of brent crude from long  term average  the new model is plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue  please note that all this analysis only applies to pllu  and that a separate study will be needed for the dzcv ppi index  regards  anjam x 35383                       forwarded by anjam ahmad  lon  ect on 09  03  2000 16  52                            anjam ahmad 08  03  2000 14  03 to  martina angelova  lon  ect  ect  harry arora  hou  ect  ect  maureen raymond  hou  ect  ect  zimin lu  hou  ect  ect  farouk lalji  hou  ect  ect cc  trena mcfarland  lon  ect  ect  dale surbey  lon  ect  ect  stinson gibner  hou  ect  ect  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  leandro ibasco  corp  enron  enron subject  update on ppi model for inflation book dear all  we thought it might be useful to incorporate brent crude as an explanatory variable for ppi  it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the long  term average of  18  80 was the best form of the variable to use  for predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is used   the three new equations developed were   pllu  t   a  rpi  t   b  rpi  t  n   c   datedbrentcrude  18  8   constant  where n is 14  15 or 16  reddish curves  r  squared approx 0  49 f  stat approx 32 the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this equation  and also the three best relations from before which were based upon current and future rpi  pllu  t   a  rpi  t   b  rpi  t  n   constant  where n is 14  15 or 16  greenish curves  r  squared approx 0  47 f  stat approx 45 comparison of models as you can see  the two equations differ in the very short  term and very long  term  the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short  term predictions of 3  0  to 3  2  over the next six months  the greenish curves predict pllu in the range of 2  5  to 2  8  over the next six months  the curves are then very similar until 2009  when the models including crude break  away to the upside  relative to the falling rpi curve  the model based purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term  this is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009  which we don  t   suggestion what could be useful now is a differently  specified model designed to forecast only the next 3 months  using auto  regressive or auto  regressive error terms  this model would be far more accurate in the near  term  and we could include this information onto the front of this long  term model  this may be useful  despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time buckets  back  testing all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data sample used  based mainly on 1990 s  new paradigm  economy   hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele  conference  your ideas on this would be appreciated  regards  anjam x 35383,ham

Subject re  steve leppard dale  my recommendation is to make steve the head of the research unit in london  we were talking originally about september but i think we should accelerate this process  of course  anjam will be very unhappy about it  but we cannot manage around him any longer  i think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase  i would like to offer him a significant increase that goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility  a salary increase will also bring him closer to the market  we see the market for technical people going through the roof in practically every location where we operate  a contract is not a good solution in my view  it creates a sense of false security for both an employee and the company  i shall send a message to john sherriff with my recommendation  i shall cc you  i would appreciate if you could bring it up with john as well  vince dale surbey 07  11  2000 10  23 am to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect cc  subject  steve leppard hi vince  hr is working on a mid  year salary review for london people that have a noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to pay in the market for a replacement  they highlighted steve as someone with a potential gap  particularly in light of what we  re seeing in our quant recruiting effort for credit trading and research  i  d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and keep him at enron  there are several things i see we can do  1  give him a mid  year pay increase to move him closer to market  i  m not sure this is the best way to go  especially if we only offer him a token salary increase  2  offer him more responsibility  what are your thoughts on timing for making steve the official head of the london research team  with my move to ebs  should we accelerate this  i think this is good way to keep him happy and motivated  and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at year  end  as part of the regular process  that takes into account his greater responsibility  3  we have some people that we  re trying to get under long  term  3  yr  contract with a 12  month notice clause  obviously anyone signing one of these will want significant up  front compensation for being handcuffed  we  ve not had a lot of success with these here in london  and i would prefer to keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually binding him to the job  i  d value your thoughts on this  thanks  dale,ham

Subject corrected  new update on ppi model for inflation book dear all  i followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows   1  use less data unfortunately  kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less robust  in fact dramatically so  and so eliminates the possibility of using less data  the model tested was the rpi  month  15  ppi pre  empts the moves in rpi by about 8 months  the magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced  this shows that if we had more detail in our rpi forward curve  then the ppi model would reflect those peaks and humps adequately  conclusion i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi  rpi  t  15  and deviations of brent crude from long  term average  the new model is plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue  the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve  it is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one  and it is considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients  which results in us having more confidence in our monthly p it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the long  term average of  18  80 was the best form of the variable to use  for predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is used   the three new equations developed were   pllu  t   a  rpi  t   b  rpi  t  n   c   datedbrentcrude  18  8   constant  where n is 14  15 or 16  reddish curves  r  squared approx 0  49 f  stat approx 32 the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this equation  and also the three best relations from before which were based upon current and future rpi  pllu  t   a  rpi  t   b  rpi  t  n   constant  where n is 14  15 or 16  greenish curves  r  squared approx 0  47 f  stat approx 45 comparison of models as you can see  the two equations differ in the very short  term and very long  term  the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short  term predictions of 3  0  to 3  2  over the next six months  the greenish curves predict pllu in the range of 2  5  to 2  8  over the next six months  the curves are then very similar until 2009  when the models including crude break  away to the upside  relative to the falling rpi curve  the model based purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term  this is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009  which we don  t   suggestion what could be useful now is a differently  specified model designed to forecast only the next 3 months  using auto  regressive or auto  regressive error terms  this model would be far more accurate in the near  term  and we could include this information onto the front of this long  term model  this may be useful  despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time buckets  back  testing all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data sample used  based mainly on 1990 s  new paradigm  economy   hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele  conference  your ideas on this would be appreciated  regards  anjam x 35383,ham

Subject re  lng may 19 decision vince  thanks for the update  what i am not sure of is what if any decision has to be made on may 19  it seems to me that the mystic lady and elba island deals have already been approved and executed  but it is quite likely i am missing a detail or two  john vince j kaminski 15  05  2000 17  14 to  john sherriff  lon  ect  ect cc  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  david gorte  hou  ect  ect  rick buy  hou  ect  ect  ted murphy  hou  ect  ect subject  re  lng may 19 decision john  this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions  1  i was not involved in the lng ship project  i shall read the dash and give you my comments  without looking at the details  i think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island project  please  see point 2   2  elba island  i am working with doug rotenberbg  brad hitch  scott earnest  sally beck  s organization  and rac to set up the book for the elba island transaction  the next step will be to expand the book to capture all the enron  s lng  related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges  a working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow  tuesday  at 8  30  a few comments on the book design and my view of the project  a  the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis  marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long  term contracts or became available due to some short  term frictions  the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long  term contract prices  the economics of the deal  as represented by the book we are setting up  will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis  arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us  in other words  we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction  b  the transaction will cover the period of 17 years  with an extension option of 5 years   even if we can lock  in the lng volumes over this time period  we have no ability to lock  in the other side of the spread  us gas prices  for such a long tenor  this is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng  nat gas spread and i would not recommend locking  in only one leg of the spread  one solution would be to cover  let  s say  50  of he lng volumes for the first 5 years and lock  in the nat gas side on the us market side  c  the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of lng  shipping rates  schedules  etc  i would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market  d  my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island deal  that are good for enron  and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions  long  term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail that correlates very well with brent  vince john sherriff 05  14  2000 01  40 am to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect cc  lauren urquhart  lon  ect  ect subject  lng may 19 decision vince i haven  t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well  anyway with greg moving to his new role i have  i hope only temporarily  staff trading oversight for the eastern hemishere plus lng  i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for lng and lng ship values  i also understand that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19  not very far away   anway i understand this is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet  can you please let me know where you stand now  i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in the next couple of days and if you have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well  look forward to connecting with you vince  john,ham

Subject dispatch within maharashtra jim  please find attached some slides that show the results of the henwood run giving dispatch for the dabhol plant within maharashtra  i have also sent the presentation we made to you to wade  he is to get back on when would be an appropriate time for him to go over the presentation with me  vince  stinson and i have placed ourselves on rebecca  s calender for friday  and we will make the complete pitch to her  it would be great if you too could be present at the meeting  if it is possible  please do let me know  on the attached slides  please note that  the slides all assume that there is a 1 part power tariff  mseb liability for the entire capacity payment is not considered  the henwood model was with no power flowing out of maharashtra when variable o  m costs  fixed o though in some months  jan  it goes as high as  69 mm  hence  overall  mseb can pay for the dispatches as shown in the henwood run provided  they are not paying for the capacity payment for the whole 2184 mw plant  in conclusion  therefore  mseb has the need for between 1200 to 410 mw on a seasonal basis  this means that the power remaining to be sold to other states is the difference between that and 2184 mw  however  since the demand within maharashtra varies seasonally  it may mean that we need to market seasonal products to other states  not long term blocks  these are our conclusions  we may continue to work some more on the fuel and hedging side  if you have any more questions for me  please let me know  else for now there will not be any new henwood runs  regards  sandeep ,ham

Subject urgent response dear sir  madam  you may be surprised to receive this letter from me  since you don  t know me personally  i am mrs maria da costa the wife of dr  john da costa  who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe  i got your contact through network on line in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of a fund to a foreign account and i decided to write you  my late husband was among the zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority  before his death he deposited the sum of us  15  2 million  fifteen million two hundred thousand us dollars  to south africa with a security company as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe  the money was deposited in a din box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the security company  this money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and establishment of new farms in lesotho and swaziland  the land problem arose when president robert mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the  modus operandi  adopted by the government  this resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs  precisely  more than fifty  one  51  people have so far been killed  heads of governments from the west  especially britain and united states of america have voiced their condemnation of mugabe  s plan  subsequently  south african development community  s  a  d  c   has continuously supported mugabe  s new land act  it is against this background that i and my family who are currently residing in south africa have decided to transfer my husband  s money into a foreign account  as a family  i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account  where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who is tactically freezing of our family wealth  and south africa  s government seems to be playing along with them  i am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in south africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history  more so  the south african foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an  asylum   as a business person whom i would entrust my future and that of my family into his hands  i must let you know that this transaction is 100  risk free and that the nature of your business does not necessarily matter  for your assistance  i will offering you 15  of the total sum  80  for my family while 5  will be mapped out for any expenses we may incur during the course of this transaction  i wish to invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice  finally  all i demand from you is assurance that you will not do away with this money when it finally gets to your personal or company  s account in your country  if this proposal is acceptable by you  please confirm your interest by contacting us on this phone number  27724263169 or e  mail address mariadacosta  2002  yahoo  com best regards  mrs maria da costa  for the family ,spam

Subject p  option valuation model mark  after recently reviewing the booking of the p  options  it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes  i  e  the price process assumptions are consistent with standard black  76 model assumptions extended to two commodities   the payoff for a call option is  payoff  max  0  a  b  k   where  a  nxwti  delivery price for nymex  b  posting price   wti swap    posting basis  k  posting bonus  fixed   the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options is that leg  b  of the spread is a combination of three prices  the two futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month  and the average posting basis during the delivery month  combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg  b  and the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of prices and its correlation with the nxwti price  i believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative  which would be to use a three or four  commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices  in summary  i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options  assuming that the inputs are set correctly  regards  stinson gibner v  p  research,ham
Subject re  gwen koepke anne  thanks for contacting me about this  as a matter of fact  i wanted to talk to you about it today as this matter was outstanding for a long time  i think we should go ahead and adjust gwen to manager  effective march 1  the compensation would be her current base plus 10 k  this is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a manager  such promotions take place in march and i think gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management  i  e  my and maureen  s procrastination   on unrelated and more serious matter  gary hickerson is the primary client for maureen  s services  he communicated to me a few weeks ago that he is unwilling to underwrite maureen  s position  he is in general unhappy with her contribution   this means that maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave enron  given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer will be quite a challenge  gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to maureen from his budget  i would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes  vince from  anne labbe  enron  enronxgate on 05  02  2001 10  34 am to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect cc  subject  gwen koepke vince  just wanted to touch base with you  i have tried to contact maureen so that gwen  s title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested  but have not heard any response from her  would you like for me to wait until i hear from maureen or should i go ahead and proceed in changing her title  i just want to make sure that gwen is in the right peer group during prc  also  i am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing  and your expectations during prc  thanks  anne,ham

Subject altos na gas model kim  i know you have been interested in the development of a long term natural gas model for use in the ets revenue management effort  i agree that the ability to model various supply  demand scenarios for north america should prove useful in ets business development efforts  and in particular  in predicting the impact of the new  large alaskan gas supplies on the n  a  pipeline grid  as you know  vince kaminski feels that a software product developed by dale nesbitt  marketpoint  inc   of los altos hills  ca  may be a good choice  and one readily available in a relatively short time  marketpoint has proposed that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and testing  so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the software  they have proposed a charge of  12  000  plus expenses  for the one  week session  with that cost applied to the first year  s subscription price  approx   55  60 m  yr  should we decide to go forward  the other details  timing  ene resources required  necessary it interface  etc  still need to be worked out  but i believe there is generally a consensus to proceed with the test  with my recent relocation to the clean fuels group  i will no longer be responsible for the alaskan pipeline development  however  danny mccarty is pulling together a team consisting of people from nng  nbp and elsewhere in ets to push the project forward  i believe eric gadd will be playing a key role as well  the decision on the long term gas model should appropriately be made by the new project team  i have attached a draft of the proposed marketpoint license agreement  it has not yet been fully reviewed by legal  or by shelley c  for the  affiliate  issues   let me know if i can provide any other background or assistance  jng,ham

to rock  recently  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment  over the next few days  as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could have  we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all over the media  in newspapers  online and on television  it became obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to bet on games  we also came across some staggering statistics  merrill lynch  for example  has predicted that gambling has the potential to account for a

important factor in the growth of e  commerce  the online gaming industry  in other words  appears to be booming  and it may be an ideal time to is time to invest  we decided to find out who the key players were in the business  after speaking with a number of industry insiders  the trail led us to an emerging  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc   ggts   after a close look at ggts  we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months  although ggts is a new company  it has some surprisingly experienced players at the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the keno

gambling games  including poker and sports  book betting  once it offers these popular games  and given that it already has keno  com online  the company could bring in great revenues  attracting a lot of attention in the investment community and driving up its stock price  after a successful north american launch  gaming transactions inc   gtts  has translated its games into chinese and is about to hit asia  this initiative looks like a wise business decision  many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest source of online gambling revenue by 2007  so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach  what does all this tell us  a brand new company  a popular  well  known game  one of the biggest spreads for the house  a

Subject non  firm power curve building hi vince  amitava and i have received a request to build a non  firm power curve for each region from david hoog  s double trigger folks  the objective  as they explain it  is to allow the desk to buy non  firm from the market  buy david  s outage product  and sell firm to the market  accountants would like a curve to mark the non  firm position  my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non  firm curve  but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in david hoog  s court to build the curve if david wants to sell his product internally to the desk  assuming we build the curve  the next issue is how to define  non  firm   the only way i can think of is to tie the non  firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units  this will allow the purchase of david  s outage product to cover the non  firmness risk  tying the definition of non  firmness to a whole region seems implausible    what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region  consequently  the non  firm curve takes on a unit  level interpretation  and not a region  level interpretation  consequently  i do not see how we can talk about the  non  firm curve for the region   we will need to build a non  firm curve for each generation unit or group of units  maybe i could get your thoughts later today  thanks  vasant,ham

Subject re  eol pricing algorithm hi bob  some comments  1  you request enron position after successful market order  but not after limit order   you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent  i am not clear on how you would use enron position  it is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position  but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere  and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual enron position to  of course  enron position may still provide some insights  2  you request bid  mid  ask prices for each trade    given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order  especially for limit orders   would you need the evolution or range of bid  mid  ask over this time interval  time of order to time of execution   also  for failed trades  you may need the evolution or range of bid  mid  ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection  this again mainly applies to limit orders  as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution  something to check        original message      from  lee  bob sent  monday  april 23  2001 8  33 am to  kaminski  vince  shanbhogue  vasant  barkley  tom cc  lu  zimin  huang  alex  gibner  stinson subject  eol pricing algorithm a draft data request for eol data we would use to study p  l patterns for the  george  pricing algorithm is attached for your review  i would like to send this to andy zipper and jay webb this afternoon  bob ,ham

Subject pricing credit on thousands of names all  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits  5  000 by year  end   most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information  making the challenge harder  and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage  what we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under development  fmc model  default probability approach   using bloomberg  s fair market  par yield  curves  probabilities are generated from the risky  libor  then default  bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology  fmc model  credit spread approach   using the fmcs  then directly taking the libor credit spread at each tenor  adjusting for basis and compounding differences  bond model  fmc approach   taking the fmcs as benchmark curves  the model regresses the input bonds  specific to a name  on the two best fitting benchmarks  the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer  prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches  under testing  bond model  spline approach   taking only the bonds specific to an issuer  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero  coupon price curve  then builds a zero yield curve from this  under testing  market prices  for certain liquid names  or sectors  ratings  cds market prices are used  then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap prices  kmv  using expected default frequencies  edfs  from the kmv model and database  we will build a model to price default swaps  making appropriate risk adjustments  kmv is being installed now  so model will be worked on next  each of these models returns a price  credit default and bankruptcy   and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors  liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and cds markets  recovery assumptions  risk premia  capital charges  etc  the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible  based upon these models  then use these prices  alongside other financial information  as the backbone to a full automated pricing system  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers  alongside name  specific  soft  data from credit reports and financial statements  if the credit is liquid enough  a price will be generated from their own information only  otherwise  the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits  with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market  or trader  prices  and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition  in loose terms  we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices  bonds  equities  default swaps   where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis  financial ratios  etc  the key steps to implementing such a system will be  establishing what exactly we want to  predict   is it a price  a rating  a probability  or a score  we will need a clean market history to calibrate to  which we only really have for ratings  we will then need to develop a mapping from rating  score to price  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the model  building the mechanics of the model  ie  the calibration methodology  neural nets  fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates  but which exact methods and software packages to use  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the model  getting the  true  market price  in order to feed back an error  at present such a price exists for very few credits  allocating resources to the development  mckinsey claimed such a system would take 6  10 man  months to develop  further ideas or comments are requested  as we need to develop our strategy asap  the model description above is fairly vague  as we don  t yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details  further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at  internet speed   regards ben,ham
Subject re  pre  submitted question on espeak erin  a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent non  technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most important references to more advanced books and papers  the book has an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page  the research group offered several one  day seminars on real options and applications to the energy industry  we still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested  we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall  the first part of the seminar  about 4 hours in the morning  covers general concept of real options and their applicability to the energy business  the second  more technical afternoon session  covers stochastic processes used to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case studies  valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas  fired power plants   the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty  nobody in this field claims that this is a perfect tool  but it represents a significant progress compared to other techniques developed earlier  discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several  in most cases  arbitrary scenarios  most likely  optimistic  pessimistic   these scenarios don  t identify explicitly the risk drivers and don  t specify the future proactive management decisions  the real  option approach is very powerful because it allows to  1  capture uncertainty in an explicit way and  2  to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to downside risk  this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and future operational decisions  forward  looking investment decisions create options that are exercised in the future through active management of a project  the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to come up with the representation of future possible states of the world  the real challenge is to use these tools in a sensible way  i have seen in my career  almost 30 years of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems  many quants armed with powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers  the challenge is not to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand specific businesses into parsimonious quantitative models  it is especially critical to stress  test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends critically on any set of assumptions  if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying assumptions  i remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the dynamics of oil prices  but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very optimistic upward trend  one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question what economics 101 teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand  enron north america corp  from  erin rice  enron 06  27  2000 03  52 pm to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect cc  subject  pre  submitted question on espeak good news  there is already a question waiting for your july 12 espeak session  i have pasted it below  although you don  t have to respond until the actual event  don  t forget to send a bulleted list of discussion topics if you would still like us to advertise the event on the elevator screens  thanks   er submitted by breineck i was doing some reading about the application of real options in the evaluation of non  financial assets  would you recommend any texts or articles for a more in  depth study of this area  is quantification of risk or uncertainty the major challenge in using this concept  can statistical tools be used with this to do a sort of sensitivity analysis ,ham

advertising now  the longer you wait  the more savvy people will be taking your business using e  mail  get what is rightfully yours  program yourself for success and dare to think big  it sounds corny  but it  s true  you  ll never make it big if you don  t have this belief system in place  multi  level marketing  mlm  has finally gained respectability  it is being taught in the harvard business school  and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50  and 65  of all goods and services will be sold through multi  level methods  this is a multi  billion dollar industry and of the 500  000 millionaires in the u  s   20   100  000  made their fortune in the last several years in mlm  moreover  statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi  level marketing  you may have heard this story before  but donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show  dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch  without hesitating trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work  the audience  started to hoot and boo him  he looked out at the audience and dead  panned his response   that  s why i  m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there   with network marketing you have two sources of income  direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business  residual income is the secret of the wealthy  it means investing time and money once  and getting paid again and again and again  in network marketing  it also means getting paid for the work of others  the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers  fortunately  sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it  my name is jonathan rourke  two years ago  the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down  sized and my position was eliminated  after unproductive job interviews  i decided to open my own business  over the past year  i incurred many unforeseen financial problems  i owed my family  friends and creditors over  35  000  the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn  t seem to make ends meet  i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business  at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially    in mid december  i received this program via e  mail  six month  s prior to receiving this program  i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities  all of the programs i received  in my opinion were not cost effective  they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not  one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year  it didn  t tell me i  d have to write a book to make it  but like i was saying  in december i received this program  i didn  t send for it  or ask for it  they just got my name off a mailing list  thank goodness for that    after reading it several times  to make sure i was reading it correctly  i couldn  t believe my eyes  here was a money making phenomenon  i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt  after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out  i would at least get my money back  but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all  so i checked it out with the u  s  post office  1  800  725  2161 24 hrs  and they confirmed that it is indeed legal  after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter  i decided  why not   initially i sent out 10  000 e  mails  it cost me about  15 for my time on  line  the great thing about e  mail is that i don  t need any money for printing to send out the program  and because all of my orders are filled via e  mail  the only expense is my time  i am telling you like it is  i hope it doesn  t turn you off  but i promised myself that i would not  rip  off  anyone  no matter how much money it cost me  here is the basic version of what you need to do  your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report  1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out  if you don  t  send out more programs until you do  your second goal is to receive at least 150  orders for report  2 within 4 weeks  if not  send out more programs until you do  once you have your 150 orders  relax  you  ve met your goal  you will make  50  000  but keep at it  if you don  t get 150 right off  keep at it  it may take some time for your down line to build  keep at it  stay focused  and do not let yourself get distracted  in less than one week  i was starting to receive orders for report  1  i kept at it  kept mailing out the program and by january 13  1 had received 26 orders for report  1  my first step in making  50  000 in 90 days was done  by january 30  1 had received 196 orders for report  2  46 more than i needed  so i sat back and relaxed  by march 1  of my e  mailing of 10  000  i received  58  000 with more coming in every day  i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car  please take time to read the attached program  it will change your life forever   remember  it won  t work if you don  t try it  this program does work  but you must follow it exactly  especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place  it won  t work  you  ll lose out on a lot of money  in order for this program to work very fast  try to meet your goal of 20  orders for report  1  and 150  orders for report  2 and you will make  50  000 or more in 90 days  if you don  t reach the first two goals with in four weeks  relax  you will still make a ton of money  it may take a few months or so longer  but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused  that  s the key  i am living proof that it works    if you choose not to participate in this program  i am sorry  it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you  if you choose to participate  follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security  if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was  or you want to start your own business  consider this a sign  i did   sincerely  jonathan rourke p  s  do you have any idea what 11  700  5 bills   58  000  look like piled up on a kitchen table  it  s awesome  a personal note from the originator of this program  by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports  you should have concluded that such a program  and one that is legal  could not have been created by an amateur  let me tell you a little about myself  i had a profitable business for 10 years  then in 1979 my business began falling off  i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me  but it wasn  t working  finally  i figured it out  it wasn  t me  it was the economy  inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945  i don  t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate    because many of you know from first hand experience  there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before  the middle class was vanishing  those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up  those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor  as the saying goes   the rich get richer and the poor get poorer   the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to  move up  or  get rich   inflation will see to that  you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life  with  no risk  and  just a little bit of effort   you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined  follow the program exactly as instructed  do not change it in any way  it works exceedingly well as it is now  remember to e  mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of  one of the people you send this to may send out 50  000    and your name will be on everyone of them  remember though  the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach  so my friend  i have given you the ideas  information  materials and opportunity to become financially independent  it is up to you now   think about it   before you delete this program from your mailbox  as i almost did  take a little time to read it and really think about it  get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate  figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it  you will still make a lot of money  you will definitely get back what you invested  any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in  it works   jody jacobs  richmond  va here  s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar  this method of raising capital really works 100  every time  i am sure that you could use up to  50  000 or more in the next 90 days  before you say  no way   please read this program carefully  this is not a chain letter  but a perfectly legal money making opportunity  basically  this is what you do  as with all multilevel businesses  we  build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products  every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners  and we offer a product for every dollar sent  your orders come by mail and are filled by e  mail  so you are not involved in personal selling  you do it privately in your own home  store  or office  this is the greatest multi  level mail order marketing anywhere  this is what you must do  1  order all 5 reports shown on the list below  you can  t sell them if you don  t have them    for each report  send  5  00 cash  the name  number of the report you are ordering  your e  mail address  and your name  return address  in case of a problem    make sure your return address is on your envelope  in case of any mail problems   when you place your order  make sure you order each of the five reports  you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them   within a few days you will receive  via e  mail  each of the five reports  save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1  000  s of people who will order them from you  2  important  do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report  or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps  a  through  g  or you will lose out on the majority of your profits  once you understand the way this works you  ll also see how it doesn  t work if you change it  remember  this method has been tested  and if you alter it  it will not work  a  look below for the listing of available reports  b  after you  ve ordered the  five reports  take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report  5  this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their  50  000  c  move the name and address under report  4 down to report  5  d  move the name and address under report  3 down to report  4  e  move the name and address under report  2 down to report  3 f  move the name and address under report  1 down to report  2  g  insert your name and address in the report  1 position  please make sure you copy every name and address accurately  copy and paste method works well   3  take this entire letter  including the modified list of names  and save it to your computer  make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter  your cost to participate in this is practically nothing  surely you can afford  25   you obviously already have an internet connection and e  mail is free  to assist you with marketing your business on the internet  the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e  mails  where to find thousands of free classified ads and much  much more  here are two primary methods of building your downline  method  1  sending bulk e  mail let  s say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and we  ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2  000 programs each  let  s also assume that the mailing receives a 0  5  response  using a good list  the response could be much better  also  many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2  000  but continuing with this example  you send out only 2  000 programs  with a 0  5  response  that is only 10 orders for report  1  those 10 people respond by sending out 2  000 programs each for a total of 20  000  out of those 0  5   100 people respond and order report  2  those 100 mail out 2  000 programs each for a total of 200  000  the 0  5  response to that is 1  000 orders for report  3  those 1  000 send out 2  000 programs each for a 2  000  000 total  the 0  5  response to that is i 0  000 orders for report  4  that amounts to 10  000 each of  5 bills for you in cash money  then think about level five  that  s  500  000 alone  your total income in this example is  50   500   5  000   50  000   500  000 for a total of  555  550    remember friend  this is assuming 1  990 out of the 2  000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program  dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone  or half sent out 100  000 programs instead of 2  000  believe me  many people will do just that and more  report  2 will show you the best methods for bulk e  mailing  and e  mail software  method  2  placing free ads on the internet 1  advertising on the net is very  very inexpensive  and there are hundreds of free places to advertise  let  s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works  assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level  placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response  also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members  follow this example to achieve the staggering results below  lst level  your 10 members with  5         50 2 nd level  10 members from those 10   5 x 100          500 3 rd level  10 members from those 100   5 x 1  000          5  000 4 th level  10 members from those 1  000   5 x 10 k          50  000 5 th level  10 members from those 10  000   5 x 100 k          500  000 this totals   555  550 remember friends  this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each  think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate  most people get 100  s of participants  think about it  for every  5  00 you receive  all you must do is e  mail them the report they ordered  that  s it  always provide same  day service on all orders  this will guarantee that the e  mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can  t advertise until they receive the report  available reports    order each report by number  and name     always send  5 cash  u  s  currency  for each report  checks not accepted   always send your order via first class mail  make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper  so that the bill can  t be seen against light  on one of those sheets of paper include   a  the number  name of the report you are ordering   b  your e  mail address  and  c  your name  postal address  in case your e  mail provider encounters problems   place your order for these reports now  report  1  the insiders guide to advertizing for free on

of the population and percentages involved  i  knew  it wouldn  t work  jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet  i made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay

Subject update  reimbursement of individually billed items the use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few years  as a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase in the number of invoices and vendors  with the higher volume  we have reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle  although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees  they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable  at times they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone  in these cases we return the invoice to the vendor  if the employee is designated  we try to track him  her down and forward the invoice  the high level of employee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this increasingly challenging  either way  we end up doing something less productive than paying invoices  to maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary for research  we request that employees who have pagers  cell phones  and other individually billed items such as licenses  subscriptions  etc   pay for them by personal check or charge card  if applicable   payment instructions are usually indicated on the invoice  and request reimbursement through employee expense reports  by submitting these charges on your expense report  you can help us reduce the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices  the number of checks generated by treasury  the number of vendors in our database  and the turnaround time for payment of invoices  incidentally  accounts payable is currently installing a corporate  wide web  based expense reporting system similar to what enron international has used for the past year  this will make it even easier to file your expense report and receive quick reimbursement  we   d like to make this effective immediately  if you have any questions or suggestions  please contact the accounts payable department ,ham

Subject re  eprm article chris  this is very well written and will serve the reader well  a few comments  1  when i think about the taxonomy of the var models  i typically use the classification based on 3 categories  a  variance  covariance method b  historical simulation c  monte carlo simulation  delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear instrument  2  i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation of behavior of all the market prices  rates  etc   and revaluation of the entire portfolio  the revaluation may be based on an approximation  using taylor  s expansion  that may involve delta  delta  gamma  delta  gamma  omega or may be exact  based on the same model that produces the mark  to  market portfolio valuations   the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way  i would emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v  c model  i shall send you the references from home   3  i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets that are evolving quickly  new instruments for which we have no comparable prices  behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de  mature   4  for bigger portfolios  virtually all methods require some level of aggregation into atomic  elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem  this process may be a source of a big error  5  the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing of a portfolio that introduces no error  many swaps with the same underlying can be aggregated into one positions  they are portfolios of forwards and they are linear instruments   please  feel free to use any comment  or none   vince  chris strickland  on 08  28  2000 02  58  56 pm please respond to  chris strickland  to  cc  subject  eprm article dear vince   d you think you might be able to look at this in the next day or so  robin is after something by the end of this week   best regards   chris    eprm  01  var  doc,ham

Subject california 1  17  01 pt  ii one of the issues we have been following with respect to the california power crisis concerns the role of prospective broader federal involvement in the issue post  inauguration  in the last two days  we have seen two signals suggesting that the bush administration will not significantly deviate from the  broker  role played by the clinton white house  1  in his confirmation hearing this morning  treasury secretary  designate o  neill cautioned that  it is not clear that us intervention is needed in california  and that the  governor must be the first line of defense   2  a source close to bush economic advisor larry lindsey reported to us yesterday that  there was little that the federal government could do specifically to help  beyond focusing on national issues  increased production  transmission capacity etc     of course  the bush treasury officials are likely to be more cautious with respect to intervention than the energy team  as was true with the clinton administration  yet lindsey in particular is unlikely to deviate far from the official bush view at this stage  further guidance should be forthcoming with respect to this issue from energy secretary  designate spence abraham  s testimony tomorrow ,ham

Subject exotica  yet again  hi guys i need some advice  sharad is in the process of finding differences between your and our versions of exotica  at some point we will need to migrate london office over to your more up  to  date version  and i  m concerned that there may be rac  style implications  i  m in favour of using the it testers to carry out formal regression testing  and they are apparently able to do this  do we need to get our heads together to  form a view  before we involve rac or the business groups  anjam tells sharad that london exotica was built using excel 95  and that neither he nor zimin knows how to build  compile the xla using later versions of excel  is this true  if so  then we need to migrate to xlls sooner rather than later because of the maintenance implications  steve,ham

the industry  if spfa would help find a  code conforming  fire barrier for attics  crawl spaces etc   than lecture on fast and loose applications of code  something about 30 cents  a bd  ft   installed  meeting all codes and spray applied  many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect but they haven  t spent the money to test over foam  maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products  report results to spfa  who in turn will  acquire funding  from us   136  2 william b  australia we are in australia but we are finding it hard to locate polyurea sprayers here so that we can start a chapter of the pda do u have any list of australian contractors  suppliers     or maybe they can put their hand up and lets us know at enviroline  powerup  com  au  it isfor the betterof the game that an association is need to inform clients and specifiers of the uses and properties of polyureas and train its own members  also to keep cowboys out that give the industry a bad name  136  3 ed m  i am a writer for aviation magazines and one that i write for is a test international  a new publication that just launched this month  i need any new processes you might have that would be used on aircraft  particularly commercial aviation   136  4 john c  louisiana i have a foam cat 2000 graco machine and a probler gun with a 01 tip  i use this setup to spray truck bed liners  my question is can i and how do i spray foam insulation using my equipment  and what are the different types of insulation   136  5 murph mahaffey  glas  craft i like the new look of the industry forum   136  6 mark w  south carolina i  m sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a  thermal barrier   what the hell do you think foam is  if you are saying that anything that can be forced to burn should be covered with a fireproof barrier  then you  d better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely not carrying a class one fire rating  this double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it  icynene is different  it doesn  t burn alone  it doesn  t melt  it doesn  t emit phosgene  does it smoke in a fire situation  sure  so what  blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car  get real  inspectors  you want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that doesn  t burn  as for the vaunted r rating system  it is totally bogus  the test is designed to make porous insulations appear to perform better than they actually do  measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer  the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is 20 years ago  along with that obsolete fiberglassgarbage they  re still selling everybody  there  s a reason they don  t make refrigerators  freezers coolers coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose  think about it   136  7 dirk benthien  forum moderator thank you  mark and dik  for your statements above  i also feel that far too often individuals and companies are too complacent and quietly live with rules and regulations without trying to change them  even if everybody knows they do not make sense  we are all experts and

never professed an r  20  reason  is there isn  t an astm test available to measure coatings for r  value  we compare standardized insulation to ceramic coatings via btu loss calculations  depending on the criteria we can equal 2 to 3 inches of standard insulation with an aluminum jacket  we have the data and the projects to prove it   136  11 cpi we have inquiries from a number of people for
